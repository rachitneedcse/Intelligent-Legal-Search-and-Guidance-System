        "full_text": "Does the act of tenant returning the keys and landlord accepting the key end tenancy. When does a the tenancy end exactly? If a tenant returns the key and the landlord accepts the key, does it end the tenancy and return the possession of property to the landlord? If a dispute arises in terms of advance after the return of the keys, can the tenant comeback later and install a new lock? Background: We had rented out our 2BHK in Tamil Nadu. We gave two months notice to our tenant to vacate. He vacated the premises and returned the key. When we asked for painting charges, he said he will return with a painter to make an estimate (we did not quote any amount since we didn't want to create a dispute). He did not return that day and the next day when we were out of station he locked the house with a new lock. We have it in writing (whatsapp messages) that he returned the key and that he returned later to put a new lock. In the messages, he also mentioned that placed his items back in the house (false because the old lock for which he returned the keys is not broken). He has sent a picture of putting the new lock as well. In the meanwhile, we returned the deposit without deducting any painting charges the next day. He hasn't been cooperating for 2 weeks. On a phone call he mentioned that he's not affected by this and he won't cooperate and he's happy and unbothered (have a recording of the call). So, the questions - whether his act of returning the key means that he has given up the possession of the property? - whether his acts of returning to place a new lock after returning the key amounts to criminal trespassing? TNRRRLT act 2017 cannot be availed by us as we didn't know about it at the time of renting and haven't registered the agreement.",
        "answers": [
            "Act of returning the key means that he has vacated the premises .it should be in writing that he has delivered vacant possession to you you should send letter to him by speed post that on retirn of security deposit and keys of the premises the tenancy has come to an end ask the tenant to remove the lock failing which you would file Poluce complaint against him of criminal trespass",
            "Once the tenant conveyed his intention to vacate and subsequently handed over keys it clearly indicates that he vacated the premises and delivered vacant possession. If he is putting a new lock after delivery of vacant possession then it can be considered as a criminal offence of illegal trespass. You can lodge a criminal complaint against him with local police for this offence.",
            "Dear Sir/Madam, From the inputs given by you, it is clear that the tenant returned the key and you accepted. Further, you returned the advance amount also. Then the keeping a new lock intact by the said person, is nothing but the unauthorised and unlawful possession of your property and you are free to take legal action in criminal side as well by police complaint as well.",
            "Handing over the key after vacating the premises is unequivocal act of surrender of tenancy. Putting again a lock amounts unlawful restrain making him liable for punishment under BNS. File a criminal complaint in the Court of Magistrate.",
            "Yes, in your case, the act of the tenant returning the keys and your acceptance clearly indicates surrender of possession and termination of tenancy. This is supported by written WhatsApp messages confirming key return, and the refund of the deposit further establishes mutual agreement to end the tenancy. Once the key was returned and deposit settled, the tenant no longer had legal possession. His subsequent act of entering and placing a new lock without permission can amount to criminal trespass under IPC Section 441, as he forcefully re-entered a property he no longer had rights to. Even though the TNRRRLT Act isn’t applicable due to non-registration, general principles of tenancy and possession under the Transfer of Property Act and Indian Penal Code still apply in your favor. You can file a police complaint for trespassing and unlawful interference in possession."

        "full_text": "Divorce after 14 years of marriage. Hello, I’m a 41-year-old Muslim man, married for 14 years, with two sons aged 12 and 10. Over time, my marriage has suffered due to manipulation, emotional strain, and consistent disrespect from my wife and in-laws towards me and my elderly parents (aged 65 and 62). While we’re currently living peacefully, I’ve lost trust and see no future in this relationship. I am now seriously considering divorce. Before initiating legal proceedings, I seek expert advice on how to safeguard myself and my parents from potential false accusations or legal misuse. Top Concerns: False dowry/harassment or domestic violence complaints False mental harassment claims Excessive alimony demands Child custody protection Preventing legal/police trouble for my parents Supporting Context: I have a video recording where my wife and father-in-law clearly state there was no dowry or harassment from our side. Around 6 years ago, we briefly lived separately (8–10 months) due to marital tension, but later moved back in with my parents. Call recordings show my wife maligning me and my parents while staying in constant contact with her family. I've heard late dowry allegations (after 10+ years) hold less legal weight—confirmation appreciated. My wife’s family has shown gaslighting/narcissistic behavior, and I fear manipulated narratives during divorce. Legal Questions: 1. What pre-emptive legal steps can I take to protect myself and my parents before filing for divorce? 2. Can a dowry or harassment case still hold after 14 years of marriage? 3. Can I file counter-cases if false claims are made? 4. What proofs/evidence will carry weight—like call logs, recordings, maid/neighbor testimony? 5. What’s the best way to manage custody/shared custody of school-aged children? 6. How to shield elderly parents from any legal trauma or arrest risk? 7. Should I consult a psychiatrist/lawyer now to document prolonged stress for protection? 8. Any expert legal input or next steps would mean a lot. I want to handle this the right way—lawfully and ethically—while protecting my children and aging parents. Thank you in advance.",

            "A wife can file a dowry harassment case, even after 14 years of marriage, as there is no time limit for filing a Section 498A case. While there are arguments that a dowry claim should ideally be filed within 7 years for a stronger case, it's not a strict legal requirement. However, a false dowry case, if proven, can lead to the woman facing legal consequences, and the husband may be able to seek compensation for mental and financial damages, as well as quash the case. If a wife files a false dowry case and it's proven to be false, she can face legal penalties under Section 182 (false information to public servant), Section 211 (false charge of an offence punishable with imprisonment), and Section 193 (false statement in a court) of the Indian Penal Code, potentially leading to imprisonment for up to 7 years. This can be done for defamation (Section 500 IPC), criminal conspiracy (Section 120B IPC), false evidence (Section 191 IPC), or even criminal intimidation (Section 506 IPC). The police will not arrest jut on the basis of the complaint, hence you may wait for the police to summon you by issuing a notice under 41 a cr.p.c. after that you can decide about obtaining AB for all if necessary. If you want to consult for mental stress you can consult a psychologist instead of a psychiatrist or a lawyer. You can file a child custody cae under G & W Act seeking custody of your children for the reasons you may rely upon. If it is no more possible to tolerate her tortures and harassment then you can even decide to dissolve your marriage by pronouncing talak e ahsan and wait for three months iddat period to confirm the talak",

Mention your parents’ age. Optionally, file a Section 107 CrPC application (preventive action) in SDM Court. False Case Protection Dowry/498A after 14 years has weak standing but is still possible. Courts require strong evidence, especially after long gaps. Be ready with anticipatory bail applications (for yourself & parents). Countermeasures If false cases are filed, you can file: Defamation (Section 500 IPC) Section 211 IPC (false case) Section 9 HMA (Restitution) or custody petition under Guardians and Wards Act Child Custody You can seek joint/shared custody or visitation rights. Courts prefer the child’s welfare, not just the mother’s claim. School-age children’s wishes are often considered. Stress Documentation Consulting a psychiatrist is useful. Medical records can help if mental harassment is claimed or contested.",

She came to our house 4 times each time staying mostly for 1 day. After that everytime we ask her to come to our hometown for celebrating festivals, she denies, she even asks who am i to question. Then we asked her to bring her parents and some elders from her church who are part of the marriage to settle the disputes, because she keeps on insulting us and she calls me a useless fellow. Everytime we ask her she says she will not bring anyone. Then one day we asked her when her transfer will come, and she said she is already transferred to bangalore and is staying in a pg for more than a month, we didn't even know that. For 7 months, i didn't even see her, whenever phone call happens, she keeps on quarelling. Finally in Feb 2025, her parents and some relative came and after discussion, she came to our house, she only lies on bed whole day only coming out for eating food even on weekends. We asked her to help in house hold chores as my mother is old and is not able to do entire work, she said she will not help. We asked her to contribute to household expenses, she said she will not give. The marriage broker on girls side already informed earlier that they want me to live seperately with her and leave my mother. I am a single parent child, i cannot leave my old mother alone. The good friday came, we asked her to come with us to hometown, she agreed, because of some work we asked her to stay at her quarters (she has quarters allotted already and she was staying there before coming to our house) since it is very near to her office whereas from my house it takes almost 1 hr to her bank. She didn't say anything. Then suddenly on evening of journey day, she didn't come back from office and she messaged that she will not come to our house and blocked my number. I called her parents, brother but no one picked the call. Finally i called her relative who came to settle in Feb 2025, he said she feels we mistreated her and she is not ready to come to our house. Now her parents are forcing me to come to Vizag to settle this and seperate. I said we both are working in bangalore, it will be a neutral place to have discussion.

        "full_text": "Elder fraud and manipulation. Hi in july 2023 , my fathers distant family member manipulated my dad and mom and coaxed my parents into signing a settlement deed for their house and land without discussion with us ( children) My elderly parents have no understanding of what they signed and surprised to learn my Dads house and land in now owned by this distant relative We have filed a case in in Mavilerika court - since October 2023 to cancell settlment deed but there is no progress . The property and land is now under the distant family member . We are awating still for issues to filed by the court but still no progress . The distant family member has removed trees from my fathers property and now renting property and keeping funds. This case should have been reversed in favor of my elderly parents who to this day can not verbalize understanding of what was signed . We tried to settle , with distant family member by asking for fair value ot home and land but he is now not willing to settle. Please advise 1> why court is taking so long for a case involving fraud and manipulation of elderly and settlement deed signed is not cancelled ? It now a 1.5 years 2. While case is going on why is distant cousin allowed to manipulate property and rent and make profit as it is prime realestate ? 3. What can be done to speed up the cancellation of settlement deed and return deed back to my parents 4. What happens if both my parents get sick or passes while ongoing court case ? 5. My parents will state that property and land would go to their children - what weight does that have on the case ? Please advise - what can be done to speed this process , cancel settlement deed and return property and land back to parents ? What can be done to stop distant cousin from renting and manipulating property as he is using it as it his own ?",
        "answers": [
            "You should seek expedited hearing as your parents are senior citizens 2) suit take 15 years to be disposed of 3) on parents demise as legal heir you can continue the case 4) once settlement deed is executed title on property passes on to relative 5) will has no effect 6) seek appointment of court receiver in the suit",
            "Delay in Court: Civil cases in India, especially property disputes, can take time due to backlog and procedural delays. However, you can file an application for expedited hearing citing elder abuse and urgency. Use of Property by Cousin: Since the deed is still legally in his name, he is able to exploit the property. File an injunction application immediately to stop him from renting, altering, or profiting from it until the case is decided. To Speed Up Case: File a petition for early hearing citing manipulation of vulnerable elders. File for temporary injunction to stop property misuse. Seek help from a senior advocate or approach High Court for quicker relief. If Parents Fall Ill or Pass Away: File a Power of Attorney or Affidavit now so children can continue legal proceedings. If they pass, legal heirs (children) can step in as plaintiffs in the ongoing case. Parents’ Statement of Intention: Their testimony that the settlement was signed under coercion and not understood is critical evidence. Also, a registered will or affidavit may support the case if they pass away. Action Steps: File injunction to stop current use of property. Move for expedited trial. Ensure legal representation for parents or heirs is secured in advance.",
            "If it’s a civil case you can go ahead with the case after their death",
            "Since you have filed the suit for cancellation of settlement deed and for possession, you may to wait for the court proceedings which will go on as per law. You can get power of attorney deed in your favour and conduct the case on behalf of your father. In the absence of your father his legal heirs can continue the case. The Will by your father may not be enforceable if he's not having clear and marketable title to the property bequeathed through the Will.",
            "Dear Client, The follwing are the analysis and asnwers to your questions. 1. Why is the court not expediting to cancel the settlement deed in light of alleged fraud and manipulation? Civil property cases, particularly ones involving fraud, coercion, or undue influence, are time-consuming because fact-finding, production of evidence, and arguments at law need time. Courts observe procedural fairness and permit each party to lay their case out, and it leads to delay. The court cannot arbitrarily cancel a registered settlement deed without adequate evidence of fraud or coercion and a trial. The remedy would be to file a suit for cancellation under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, which is discretionary and time-consuming. 2. Why can the distant relative take on rent and earn money from the property while the case is still pending? Once the settlement deed is registered, the distant relative is the legal owner until the court rules otherwise. Courts do not normally interfere with possession or use of property during litigation unless a temporary injunction or stay order is issued. Unless you have obtained a temporary injunction restraining the relative from renting or alienating the property, they legally can continue possession and earn income. 3. What can be done to expedite cancellation and retrieve property from your parents? Plead for early hearing or relief (interim injunction) to stop the relative from dealing with the property during the suit. Lay robust documentary and witness evidence establishing fraud, manipulation, and incapacity of your elderly parents to execute the deed knowingly. Appoint a skilled advocate to press for case listing and speed up proceedings. Negotiate mediation or settlement if possible, but if the relative does not agree, proceed with litigation. Sue for criminal fraud or forgery if supported by evidence, which can also bring pressure. 4. What if your parents get ill or die during the case? The case can be proceeded with by their legal representatives or legal heirs. Their inability or death does not necessarily invalidate the suit; successors can fill their shoes to carry on the claim. It is recommended that a power of attorney or legal guardian be appointed to handle proceedings if parents are unable. 5. What value is your parents' assertion that property should belong to their children? Your parents' intention or spoken words are significant but not decisive without written evidence (Will or registered document). Courts mainly use registered deeds and documentary proof. But proof of manipulation and deprivation of consent can be in your favor to get back property to parents and ultimately to heirs"

In the deed it is also mentioned that his son's should get equal share in the property. RTC and mutation was updated, but not registered in sub register office. In 2004, Mr.X's wife alone sold the subject land to Mr.Y (Mr.Y was minor in 2004, Mr.Y's mother registered the property as minor gardien). There was 70000 rs loan on the property when Mr.Y purchased the land in 2004. Which is still uncleared till date. The loan was taken by Mr.X's wife.

Since Mr. Y is in possession for over 21 years, it could be argued — but only if the possession was open and hostile, which is uncertain here due to the defective 2004 sale.

An association in a commercial building can typically recover both outstanding maintenance amounts and the corpus fund held by the builder. The association can take legal action, including filing a complaint with the consumer court or RERA, to recover these funds. If the builder fails to hand over the pending maintenance charges, the association can take legal action, such as filing a money recovery suit or a complaint with the consumer court, to recover the dues.",

As per rule, the society can charge higher maintenance fees from commercial units compared to residential units on the ground that the commercial units require more services. - The association can pass a rule in the GBM. 2.

For the unsold units the builder /landowner is under obligation to pay the maintenance fees.",

I am based in the UK and I have received a letter from the International Assistance Unit of the UK Police saying they have been asked by the Authorities in India via the UK Home Office, to provide me with court documentation in relation to a court hearing in India on 27th May. I believe this is under Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA). On the phone he said the GOI require information from me regarding an individual that India want to extradite. The police need to deliver the documents to me in person and I need to provide ID and sign a receipt. He said that under UK law, as a British citizen, I am not obliged to comply with the process and I can refuse to accept the documents or accept them and not take any action. He said I should take legal advice as to the consequences of failing to comply under Indian law. My concern is that I travel to India often, and I am worried that if I refuse to accept the documents, there may be consequences when I next go to India e.g. contempt of court, fines, arrest, prison term. Can you advise on this?",

        "full_text": "Eviction of tenant. I am the landlord of a property in Bangalore. I had entered into a 3-year rental agreement (on ₹500 stamp paper, not registered or notarized) with the tenant. The 3-year tenure is coming to an end in the next 3 months. The agreement mentions that it can be renewed thereafter with a 10% rent hike each year. However, during the tenancy: There have been repeated delays and short payments of rent ( some outstanding amounts still pending). Water bills have not been paid for the past year despite multiple reminders. The tenant has also become unresponsive to calls and requests for discussions. I have issued an email notice asking the tenant to vacate and clear dues. My questions are: 1. Given the unregistered agreement, can I still initiate legal notice and eviction proceedings based on ownership and misuse? 2. Can the tenant stop paying rent if she files a during proceeding? 4. Does the renewal clause hold any validity without a registered document? The exact words in the agreement are \"The rental amount will be increased every year by 10% after 3 years\" . Can there be such infinite term without an end date ? The tenent is citing this clause and stating they can continue infinitely with just rent increase of 10% Kindly advise.",
        "answers": [
            "1. As the tenure of the current rental agreement is coming to an end in three months, you can issue a legal notice to the tenant to vacate the premises right on the next day after the expiration of the rental agreement. You can mention the reasons that due to his bad attitude on many occasions you are not willing to renew the rental agreement anymore and inform him strictly to vacate immediately on expiration of current rental agreement. 2. We cannot predict what the tenant will do if she's filing a case against you but you can always demand the monthly rental amount in your reply to her case. 3. The unregistered rental agreement is not enforceable in law besides the renewal is the discretion of the landlord.",
            "1. Yes you can still evict him. You can register your agreement with penalty 2. you can direct the court or authority to direct tenant to pay rent during pendency of proceedings 3. you can also evict the tenant before the expiry of agreement too",

Tenant can't stop paying rent: Even if the tenant files a case, they must continue paying rent. Court can order them to deposit dues. Renewal clause invalid: The \"10% increase\" clause does not create infinite tenancy. After 3 years, the tenant is month-to-month, and you can terminate with notice. Send formal legal notice via a lawyer (not just email). Demand dues and vacant possession within 15-30 days. File eviction suit if the tenant refuses.",

As per law, if the tenancy period is more than 11 months then the registration of the rent agreement is mandatory - However, as there a contract between you and the said tenant by way of that unregistered agreement, then also you can evict him 2. The tenant is under obligation to pay the rent , and you can claim the arrears with the eviction on this ground. 3. Since, this agreement was only for 3 years , then you can enter into a fresh rent agreement with him. The tanant cannot take any plea if he is not paying the rent regularly."

        "full_text": "Tenant defaulting on rent. Hi, I own a flat in Hyderabad. It is on rent at a monthly rate of INR45,000 and we have an unregistered rental agreement. The tenant has been in the house since March 2022. We have been renewing the lease every eleven months and the last lease started in Jan 2025. In my last signed lease agreement there are no witnesses. The tenant had signed the agreement and posted to our address. Then we signed and sent him a copy. The tenant is late on his rent by one month and keeps on delaying the payment. Otherwise, he has been paying the rent electronically but with occasional delays. I believe, I may need to file an eviction and money recovery suit. I still have about 2 months' deposit that I received from the tenant. In this context, could you please let me know the following: - Any lawyers who take up such work in Hyderabad - Do I need to come personally to Hyderabad or can it be done remotely? - What would be the typical time required and costs if we have to litigate? - Will lack of witnesses in the agreement be a problem? - Is it possible and advisable to file money recovery summary suit separately (i.e. without mixing it with eviction suit) Thanks",
        "answers": [
            "Number of lawyers on this website from Hyderabad contact any of them 2) it should not take more than 2 years 3) you can execute POA in favour of family member to appear on your behalf 4) don’t file separate recovery suit 5) file eviction suit and also claim arrears of rent",
            "If the tenant has committed wilful default in payment of monthly rental amount continuously for two months or more then you can issue a legal notice to him instructing him to vacate and deliver vacant possession by giving him 60 days time to do so. The reason for eviction can affect the notice period, with breaches of the lease agreement potentially leading to shorter notice periods. It may be noted that if the tenant committed wilful default in payment of rent, for the two consecutive months, then the landlord is entitled to issue an eviction notice giving him time to vacate the premises and deliver vacant possession. Failing to comply with the demands made, the landlord can file an eviction suit. The time taken for disposal of eviction suit cannot be predicted owing to various factors involved in it and it may take more than two years also. You can give a power of attorney deed in favor of your close relative in India to conduct the case on your behalf. The litigation expenses and the lawyer's fee will be intimated by the lawyer who you may be engaging for this purpose. Money recovery suit can be filed separately for the money you have lent to the tenant on the basis of the documentary evidences for proving the money transactions.",
            "You can appoint lawyer and file a eviction suit you don’t have to come you can do the needful from outside India all other questions and is yes",
            "Personal Appearance: Although some procedural steps need your presence, most of the process—filing and hearings—can often be done remotely by your attorney. Time and Costs: Eviction actions usually take a few months to more than a year depending on the court calendar. Costs differ but anticipate attorney fees plus court fees; an attorney can give estimates based on your case details. Witnesses to Agreement: Unavailability of witnesses is not a problem if you have agreements and payment records electronically if you have them. The Courts recognize such documents, but witnesses add weight to your case. You can locate experienced rental dispute attorneys in Hyderabad through local legal directories or property management companies or though an online research. Most lawyers deal with such cases professionally. You can also institute a separate money recovery suit for outstanding rent and deposit claims. It is to be noted that it is better to maintain eviction and money recovery suits separately to facilitate proceedings. Process to be followed: Serve a formal notice of eviction for non-payment of rent (over 1 month delay is eligible). If tenant fails to comply, institute an eviction suit in the Rent Control Court with your rental contract, payment receipts, and ownership papers. For recovery of rent, institute a summary suit in the civil court to recover arrears and deposit if not returned. Adhering to the Telangana Rent Control Act and serving proper legal notices will be in your favour.",
            "1. You can search for property lawyers or legal firms specializing in landlord-tenant disputes in Hyderabad through online legal directories, local bar associations, or recommendations from friends or family. Websites like Justia, Legal Services India, or local law firms can be good starting points. 2. While it is often beneficial to be present for legal proceedings, many lawyers can handle cases remotely, especially for initial consultations and documentation. However, you may need to appear in court for hearings, depending on the case's progress. 3. Litigation timelines can vary widely. An eviction suit may take anywhere from a few months to over a year, while a money recovery suit can take a similar time frame. Costs will depend on the lawyer's fees, court fees, and other expenses, but it’s advisable to discuss this directly with your chosen lawyer for an estimate. 4. While having witnesses can strengthen your case, the lack of them in an unregistered rental agreement may not be a significant barrier. The signed agreement itself serves as evidence of the terms. However, it’s best to consult a lawyer about the specific implications in your case. 5. You can file a money recovery suit separately from the eviction suit. This is often advisable as it allows you to focus on each issue distinctly. Your lawyer can guide you on the best approach based on your circumstances. It’s essential to consult with a qualified lawyer to get tailored advice and to proceed with your case effectively."

We have been working on redevelopment but lot of people are hindering the process due to their wasted interest. I stay in building 3 and one of the member who claims he has lot of knowledge around property legal matters suggested that all 1,2,3,4 will never be on same page and agree to single builder for redevelopment so he suggested that we as building 3 should move out from Apartment act and register only building 3 as Society act. Per him, there were several constitutional amendments made in 2021 which allows this to happen. Below are some of my questions. 1 - Is it really possible for single building within a condominium to move out and register? Would we require NOC from other buildings ( 1,2,4)? 2 - Some of the members in my building do not have deed of apartment and only have agreement for sale 3 - We also have an ongoing case with a builder who has Power of attorney and development rights ( Initial builder gave this to new builder to construct building 5,6,7) so we filled a case to stop construction of new buildings and we have status quo from high court 4 - since this case was filed by condominium and it has status quo, can builder challenge that we breached status quo by starting the process of registering as society without his NOC.

Disruption During Cross: File an application before the trial court asking for a chance to complete cross-examination, mentioning the disruption and seeking re-summoning under fair trial principles. 3. Video Statements from IO: File an application to court under Section 91 CrPC requesting the court to summon the IO to produce the video statements recorded during investigation. 4. Filing False Case Complaint (Section 22 POCSO): After your father’s acquittal, you can file a complaint under Section 22 POCSO against the complainant for false complaint. Filing before acquittal is premature. 5. False Evidence Action (Section 340 CrPC): After trial/acquittal, you can file Section 340 CrPC application against the girl for giving false evidence once she was an adult. 6. Witness Non-Appearance: Court can issue bailable or non-bailable warrants under Section 312 CrPC and even initiate proceedings under Section 174 IPC for repeated non-appearance.",
            "Yes you can do recall of withnes you can file rti application for getting videos if not filed in court after your acquittal you can file case against complainant for false prosecution only for false statement on oath in court you can initiate 195-340 crpc Issuing warrant against them",
            "if a witness does not appear for cross-examination, the court can issue a bailable warrant to compel their presence 2) 3) don’t make any application under section 349 at this stage 4) Section 22(1) provides for a maximum of six months of imprisonment or fine or both to those who provide false information, regarding sexual assault against children, solely with the intention to humiliate, extort, threaten or defame an individual against whom the complaint under the Act was being made. 5) However, Section 22(2) makes it clear that if the false complaint or false information of sexual assault had been provided by a child, then no punishment shall be imposed on such child. Therefore, the judge can order prosecution only against those who had instigated the tchildren to lodge the false complaint. 6) A party must file an application with the court requesting access to the video recordings, providing reasons for the request, and obtaining a court order before the recordings can be accessed",
            "1. How are you related to the case, are you an accused? If not the accused only has to file an application for recall of the witness based on the documents he may rely upon to defend his interests, you can inform your advocate. The party seeking to recall the witness must file an application under section 311 with the court, stating the reasons for the recall and why the witness's further examination is essential for a just decision. The court has the discretion to grant or deny the application based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. The court must consider whether the witness's testimony is essential for the just decision and whether it is being sought to fill in gaps in the case. 2. If a cross-examination is halted and the witness doesn't return, the party attempting cross-examination may move to have the witness recalled or, depending on the circumstances and applicable laws, the witness's testimony may be considered incomplete or withdrawn. In criminal cases, the court may draw adverse inferences from the lack of cross-examination. 3. The accused has the right to inspect the evidence during cross-examination. This right is crucial for the accused to defend themselves adequately by challenging the credibility of witnesses and testing the veracity of their statements. 4. If the accused proves a false accusation during the trial, the court should direct the police to register a case under Section 22 of the POCSO Act and proceed accordingly 5. When a victim turns 18, the case is no longer considered a juvenile case under the Juvenile Justice Act. The POCSO Act remains applicable, but the proceedings may shift to the adult courts. False allegations under the POCSO Act present a significant challenge to the justice system. While the Act is crucial for safeguarding children from sexual offenses, its stringent provisions can be misused by individuals with malicious intent. 6. If a witness fails to appear for cross-examination after three scheduled dates, the court can take various actions, including issuing a warrant of arrest, imposing a fine, or ordering the witness's property to be sold. The court may also consider the witness's testimony to be invalid, and the case may proceed without their testimony."

One our employee joined & then didn't work at all, we watched him for 15-20 days & saw no improvement & then asked him to leave after 33 days. We offered him 15 days salary (just symbolic as he didn't complete any task) but he started demanding salary, notice period pay citing that employer has terminated. He has sent us a labor court notice. What can we do as an employer now? 2) Another employee joined us & 15 days after joining complained about stone pain, then went on for leave for medical surgery & filed 2.5 Lacs Mediclaim. His Mediclaim is approved but not yet paid by the insurance agency. He resigned in 15 days after his surgery. He also cited his family member's death & mother's hospitalization & practically didn't work. His total duration in our company is 62 days. As an employer, can we top his medical claim to be re-imbursed? Can we ask him to re-pay the salary that's being paid to him as he couldn't justify any work. Also what does Law say to put in the employment policy for insurance claim by employees due to frauds in the company and industry. Is it legally right to say that \"Medical claims will be entertained only after employee is confirmed not during probation\"? 3) Third employee worked with us for 2 years, because of his negligence we suffered heavy losses in one of our projects & then we asked him to leave. He resigned willfully & then we did his Full & Final. We deducted Rs 25,000 out of Rs 1.1 Lacs owed to him in compensation to the losses in the project. He accepted his Full & Final willingly, signed the papers & then we transferred the money to him. After about 1.5 month of his getting money, he started mailing us that we have forcefully got papers signed & if he will not get Rs 25,000 then he will go to labour court. What should we do now?

Policy tip: State Mediclaim applies only after confirmation (legal if pre-declared). 3️⃣ ₹25k Deduction Case: If F&F signed and paid, you're safe.

            "1. Probationary periods are often applied to new employees as a means of determining their capabilities in a new job. - Hence, the employer can terminate during the probation, and employee can also leave the job with the terms and conditions mentioned in the appointment letter for probation. - Further, many company stipulates in contract, that during probation period either party can terminate the job with or without any notices. - Since, that employee has worked only 15-20 days then he cannot claim the amount of notice period because he not worked for the same. 2. If the said refusal by the Insurance company then he should lodge a complaint against that company and not from you. 3. Since, that employee has already singed and availed the full and final settlement amount from your company then he cannot refuse for the same on any ground. - You can submit your reply with the said acceptance letter before the labor Court. His case is not maintainable."

            "As an OCI (Overseas Citizen of India) selling a property in Bangalore at a capital loss, you are still subject to TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) under Section 195 of the Income Tax Act, as the obligation to deduct TDS applies regardless of whether the sale results in a gain or loss. However, since there is no actual gain, you can apply for a NIL or lower TDS certificate from the Income Tax Department by filing Form 13 online—this certificate, once issued, allows the buyer to deduct TDS at a lower rate (even zero, if approved). To proceed, it is mandatory for you to obtain a PAN card, which is required both for applying for the certificate and for filing your Income Tax Return in case of any refund claim. Once you have the PAN and the certificate, the buyer will also need to file Form 15CA and, if necessary, Form 15CB (issued by a Chartered Accountant) before remitting the sale proceeds to you. If TDS is deducted despite the loss, you can file a return at the end of the financial year to claim a refund.

            "Dear sir, The course of action to be followed is given below 1. Legal Ground for Property Transfer Rights of Ownership: According to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, amended in 2005, all children (including daughters) are equally entitled to ancestral property. Because your father's plots were jointly held in your mother's name, on her passing away in 2022, her share automatically goes to all four legal heirs (you and your three sisters). The legal heir certificate that is issued by the Tehsil (mentioning your mother and four children) is considered as a valid document is considered sufficient in proving your status as legal heirs. The Tehsil cannot further choose to refuse this on grounds without providing any proper legal justification. 2. Tehsil's Refusal: Addressing Their Concerns The Tehsil's denial on the grounds of your non-residence and absence of local address evidence is not legally sustainable. Mutation and property transfer are based on rights of ownership, not residence. Procedural obstacles can be overcome as follows: Steps to Overcome Tehsil's Objections: File Relinquishment Deeds from Sisters: As your sisters are married but agree, they need to sign registered relinquishment deeds (on stamp paper) specifically handing over their share in their favour. This is a required under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908. The following are the documents are required: The relinquishment deeds with the signatures of sisters and two witnesses. Sisters' notarized affidavits asserting their agreement. A Copy of the legal heir certificate and the death certificates of your parents. It is recommended to provide the ID proof such as the Aadhaar, PAN, or Voter ID (even with non-local addresses) It is also further recommended to take an affidavit stating the reason why the family shifted out in 2014 and submit the relevant reasons (e.g., work, studies) to avoid confusion. Affidavits of neighbours/relatives in the original area attesting to your family's ownership and your identity can serve as witness statements. Make a written application (through your lawyer) requesting the Tehsil to carry out a field inquiry to confirm the historical ownership records and the testimonies of local people (e.g. neighbours, ex-tenants). 3. Legal Remedies if Tehsil Continues in Refusal If the Tehsil still refuses the mutation , in such cases: Option 1: File a Revision Petition Proceed to Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) under Section 210 of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006, opposing the inaction of the Tehsil. Option 2: File a Writ Petition in the High Court File a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Allahabad High Court for a writ of mandamus (to direct the Tehsil to apply the mutation). 4. The important Documents required include the following: Legal heir certificate ( mentioning the mother and four children in it). The Death certificates of the parents. Both the sisters' relinquishment deeds (registered). Respective affidavits of non-residence and the witness statements. The Title deeds to the property (in mother's name). Provide for the indemnity bond (if it is being required by the Tehsil). 5. The Practical Tips which may be necessary. Recommended to hire a Local Lawyer: A local lawyer can handle the case at hand with the Tehsil, it would help to speed up the field verification. The lawyer can also appear for you at hearings. To file a Grievance Online: Utilize the government portal (upbhulekh.gov.in) to raise a complaint or check mutation status of the property at hand. Take advantage of the Legal Heir Certificate: It is important to highlight that this certificate serves as a valid evidence of inheritance."

        "full_text": "Can a GPA holder of a villa become residents welfare association President?. Hello all, Our society is registered with ksra 1960. Last year on August we conducted our first elections to elect all the office bearers. Before that there were a group of volunteers who came forward to work on the society registration and get the deed of declaration from the builder. During the election the then office bearers appointed a voluntary group as election committee to oversee the election. The election committee on their part created a nomination form for all candidates. In the nomination form they have made all the candidates to self declare that \" They are an owner of a villa in the society and that they have a registered sale deed in their name\" . The election committee on trust did not checked the ownership documents of all the candidates. Now it has come to light that the current president is not an owner of the villa he resides. When this was brought to the general secretary, he says that the president is holding an registered GPA and that he is vested with full legal authority to act on behalf of the property owner, and is entitled to exercise all rights and powers pertaining to said property. He also says that they have reviewed and confirmed this with the legal counsel. We tried to reason with him regarding the supreme court ruling on the gpa holders however he is reluctant to take any action on this. He claims that the gpa holder can be a part of the office bearers as per the society legal counsel and that he is not ready to ask the president to step down. Some of the members feel like this will lead to confusions and issues and will set a precedent in the future. Our bye laws don't say anything about gpa holder. is it right that the gpa holder can become an office bearer ? Is it considered as an owner of the property? Is the action of general secretary is right ? Please advice",
        "answers": [
            "GPA holder cannot stand for elections and be a office bearer in the society he is not the owner of villa but only power of attorney holder",
            "1. If the registered GPA holder is authorised to act on behalf of the owner of Villa, then the GPA holder can become an office bearer. 2. GPA holder can't be considered as the Owner. 3. The action of general secretary is legally right.",
            "No, a GPA holder is not considered the legal owner as per the Supreme Court (Suraj Lamp case, 2011). If your society’s nomination form required a registered sale deed in the candidate’s name, the current president is not eligible. The General Secretary’s claim that a GPA holder can act as an owner is incorrect for society membership and election purposes—unless your bye-laws specifically allow it (which they don’t). His appointment is invalid, and this can set a wrong precedent. Suggested actions: Raise a written objection to the Executive Committee. Call for a Special General Body Meeting. Escalate to the Registrar of Societies if needed.",
            "Based on the facts you've shared, I can confirm that under established law, particularly GPA holder is not recognised as the legal owner of a property. Ownership is determined strictly through a registered sale deed in the individual's name. If your society's nomination form required candidates to self-declare ownership backed by a registered sale deed, and the current office bearer does not meet this requirement, then his election may be legally invalid and open to formal challenge. The general secretary’s position, even if backed by legal advice, cannot override statutory provisions or Supreme Court precedent. Such situations—if not addressed now—can indeed set problematic precedents and compromise the integrity of future elections and society governance. I would be happy to assist you in resolving this decisively—whether through a structured notice, a review of the society bye-laws, or by initiating corrective action via the Registrar of Societies. This matter calls for a precise legal approach to ensure compliance and protect the interests of all genuine stakeholders. Let me know how you'd like to proceed, and we can take this forward efficiently.",
            "The GPA deed is neither a title document nor the power agent can be treated as a owner of the property for any reason. The election to association clearly mandates apart from other eligibility conditions that a person contesting the election should be an absolute owner with registered title document on his or her name. The current president has occupied the post by playing fraud and the opinion obtained from an advocate in this regard is also legally incorrect. A special meeting of the association can be called for discussing about this irregularity and to strip the president of his post, to conduct fresh election for the post of the president with the concurrence of the deputy registrar of cooperative society. If the management committee is not in favour of this proposal then you can make a complaint about this irregularity to the deputy registrar of cooperative society for intervention and for passing suitable orders as prescribed in law for this purpose."

        "full_text": "Hospital forcing discharge of paying bedridden terminal patient. My father, 75, is in Stage 4 cancer. Admitted to hospital for complications. Now better but still bedridden with a feeding tube. His prognosis is terminal (untreatable). Basic charges are no problem and being paid, but hospital keeps persisting in pushing for extra care such as catheters, infusions and stronger antibiotics. This was running up a huge bill above the basic charges. We previously signed a comfort-care-only form. When we refused some strong antibiotics four days ago (until the bacteria was cultured and sensitivity determined), the doctor seemed to be unhappy and now is saying we have to discharge him the next day (tomorrow). We have no support system at home as my mother herself is 75 years old and I live abroad and am the only child. Can the hospital discharge him against our wishes? How can we legally force the hospital to keep him for one or two weeks (on payment of all the basic charges) until we can make alternative arrangements? It will take at least one week for me to arrange to visit India. ------------------- Background/Nuances: One aspect of the antibiotics is that the doctor said that if an infection is not treated it may affect other patients. So we had merely requested a 48-hour hold rather than a refusal because it was hastily prescribed by a different doctor while the treating doctor was on leave, until it was determined more conclusively by other investigations. However in the last four days they haven't been doing much further investigation or monitoring. My father appears healthier and it is likely that his existing antibiotic + immune system has controlled it. But in the absence of a repeat WBC test it is difficult to know. ADDITIONALLY, I'm happy to compromise on the antibiotics if that's what it takes to keep him in the hospital. However, it seems fishy legally that they can force that on the threat of a forcible discharge. Finally, before the antibiotics there was a long chain of questionable treatments that they had pushed and we had reluctantly accepted, such as Rs. 50,000 per day of albumin infusions while protein powder could have worked via feeding tube. The most notable procedure was installing a PICC IV line/catheter just 6 days ago at a cost of Rs. 50,000, which is used to deliver medicines long term for up to 6 months. So it is a surprise that after installing that long term expensive line for treatment, they suddenly want to discharge him.",

        "full_text": "Can I file cheating case on my wife and in-laws under 420 IPC. Eight years ago, I was approached by a businessman with a marriage proposal for his adopted daughter. He mentioned that he did not have any biological children and had adopted a girl who was a dentist. He expressed that they were looking for a suitable alliance within the medical profession. During our discussions, he claimed to own multiple schools and colleges located in various towns. He assured me that after marriage, his daughter would take over the administration of these institutions, while her husband would help manage their future plans to establish hospitals. After several meetings with the businessman, I was convinced and agreed to the marriage. However, after our wedding, his behavior changed drastically. He started avoiding our calls and made excuses to escape meeting us. Surprisingly, during important occasions such as the delivery of our child and other family ceremonies, my wife's biological parents were the ones who were actively involved, not the businessman who claimed to have adopted her. Upon further investigation, I discovered that my wife had not been legally adopted as claimed by the businessman. Despite feeling deceived, I chose to accept this and continued with my marriage. Over time, I noticed that my wife's biological parents were excessively interfering in our marital life. Their behavior was rude and controlling, which led to frequent disputes between my wife and me. Adding to these issues, I discovered that my wife was misusing money and transferring significant amounts to her biological parents. This created further friction in our relationship. Their interference and her financial actions have severely impacted our marital harmony. I strongly suspect that her biological parents were the masterminds behind this entire conspiracy to deceive me into the marriage. Due to the irreparable differences arising from these issues, my wife and I are now living separately, and I have filed for divorce. Given the circumstances, I wish to know if I can file a cheating case under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the businessman, my wife, and her biological parents for deceiving me into agreeing to this marriage based on false claims.

I got into a situation where my EMIs where 3 to 4 times more than my salary as I had used my multiple credit cards, taken multiple personal loans from banks and multiple app loans. I had 30 accounts which i had defaulted and filed a case of insolvency last 2 years back which is still running in the court of law.

I took a personal loan of 50 lacs which had an EMI of 1.08 lakhs per month which i paid for 22 months and post that i defaulted as i couldn't pay due to the losses and multiple accounts getting defaulted. But before defaulting I had approached the bank twice to restructure my loan which the bank didn't agree for it and finally i had no choice but to default. Now they have asked me to settle the account for 18 lakhs as the current outstanding with interest is 35 lacs, but i don't have so much of money to pay them back and they are not ready to give me any EMI option. The DRT case next hearing is scheduled in the month of May. My question is what will happen in the DRT case as I don't have any asset or property in my name or my wife's name or my mother's name. The only source which i have is my salary, so will the DRT give me an option to pay monthly EMI as I have other bank loans, credit cards and ODs which i need to pay monthly or will they pass any order.

The purpose of this moratorium is to allow the debtor to restructure their debts and explore resolution options without the immediate pressure of legal action. As far as pending DRT case, if you default on a loan and have no assets to repay the loan amount in a DRT (Debt Recovery Tribunal) case, the bank may proceed with recovery actions, which could include taking possession of secured assets if any, and ultimately selling them to recover the outstanding debt. The DRT may also issue orders to compel you to repay the loan, and if you fail to comply, the bank can potentially pursue further legal avenues for recovery, such as wage garnishment or seizing other assets if they can be identified. You can also try to negotiate a One-Time Settlement (OTS) with the bank to resolve the issue. Once you lost the DRT case you can do nothing. The Bank will take it own course for recovery of money.

The DRT may take into account the borrower's financial capacity and ability to repay the debt, when deciding on the terms of repayment or granting a debt restructuring plan. In essence, while the DRT is empowered to ensure the recovery of debts, it also has the flexibility to consider a defaulter's economic circumstances in its decision-making process, particularly when it comes to devising repayment plans or restructuring debt. you may present your side situation to convince the DRT accordingly and place your proposals with the evidences of your poor economic background and await the orders."

You must note tht the agreement holder has given a substantial amount towards purchase of the property hence the risk is that in caase he turns up then the court may pas a verdict in his favor too because it is not barred by limitation as the land owner himself has re-activated the expired agreement by approaching the court hence the agreement gets a new period of limitation from the date of filing the suit by the landowner",

        "full_text": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against. We are facing a legal situation involving a 30+ year-old builder-floor property in Delhi comprising 8 independent flats. The property lacks a sanctioned building plan, Occupation Certificate (OC), and Completion Certificate (CC), though each flat is registered independently in the names of different owners. Recently, a builder/developer has entered the picture and started acquiring units. As of now: 5 out of 8 flats have been acquired by the builder or his associates (over 62.5% ownership). 1 more Dissenting Owner (DO) is currently in talks and may sell soon. Only 2 DOs are holding out, refusing the current offer citing extremely low compensation, lack of transparency, and undervaluation. The builder is aggressively pursuing acquisition with the intent of demolishing and redeveloping the property. The remaining DOs are concerned that if the builder reaches 6 or more units, he might move to: File for partition in court. Request an auction of the entire property. Try to undervalue the property to secure it cheaply in a court-led auction process. Coerce or harass remaining DOs into surrendering rights through pressure tactics. We need expert legal input on the following: 1. Builder’s Possible Legal Routes (As being threatened by him): What legal remedies can the builder now invoke to force acquisition or possession of the remaining units? Can he approach the court for a partition and force a sale through public or court-supervised auction? Can the builder request the court to appoint a valuer and push for undervaluation or collude to get a lower reserve price? 2. Risks of Valuation Manipulation: How common or legally permissible is undervaluation or manipulation of base prices in partition auction cases? Are there known Delhi cases where builders acquired property through partition suits and undervalued auctions? 3. Legal Remedies & Strategies for DOs: What immediate legal steps can DOs take to prevent undervaluation or coercion? (e.g., caveats, RTIs, legal notices, objections) How can DOs demand High Court oversight or fair valuation mechanisms? What is the realistic probability of: Securing a stay on any unfair auction or partition sale? Getting the auction supervised by the High Court? Challenging and halting redevelopment until fair terms are negotiated? 4. Long-term Outcomes and Legal Cost: What are the long-term outcomes DOs can realistically expect if they do not consent to current offers? What are the approximate timelines and legal expenses from lower court to High Court or Supreme Court if the matter escalates? Is there a practical way DOs can secure higher compensation or better terms if they resist? Kindly advise on the best course of action and share any precedents or practical examples that may help us.",

            "For redevelopment of property tenders have to be floated 2) redevelopment has to be approved in AGM 3) holder has to enter into development agreement t with flat owners 4) if majority of flat owners are in favour building would go in fir redevelopment and development agreement signed by builder with flat owners 5) redevelopment would not be stayed if majority favour redevelopment 6) builder cannot file partition suit as all flats are independent 7) property would not be auctioned 8) legal fees vary friending upon lawyer engaged by you 0) litigation is long drawn and expensive proposition",
            "You're dealing with a common yet complex issue in Delhi involving builder-floor redevelopments where a builder acquires majority units (5 of 8, possibly 6 soon) and pressures remaining dissenting owners (DOs) into selling. Legally, if the builder claims the property as undivided (due to no OC, CC, or sanctioned plan), he may file a partition suit and seek a court-ordered auction. In such cases, there’s a real risk of undervaluation, especially if the builder influences the valuation process. This has happened in past Delhi cases, where court-supervised sales favored builders due to low reserve prices. To protect your interests, DOs should immediately file caveats in local and High Court, issue a legal notice asserting ownership rights, and file RTIs with MCD/DDA regarding building legality. If partition or auction is initiated, demand a court-appointed independent valuer and request High Court supervision for transparency. Filing a writ petition under Article 226 is a strong option if there's coercion or procedural unfairness. While litigation may stretch 5–10 years with costs ranging ₹5–30 lakhs, resisting can lead to higher compensation or better redevelopment terms. Joint legal action by DOs improves your position significantly.",
            "1. The builder may move court for partition since the building has no OC or CC besides there are two dissenting owners for redevelopment. In that case the DOs would be made as parties to the suit, they can then challenge the suit filed by him on merits and can oppose the valuer or commissioner recommended by the builder, instead they can request the court to appoint independent valuer or a commissioner. 2. Any person who intends to grasp the properties by any illegal means can adopt any type of strategy including the under valuation of the property therefore it is not an uncommon situation. you need to exercise cautionary measures accordingly. 3. A builder cannot unilaterally demand a partition of independent flats solely based on owning a majority share, as each flat owner has a right to their property and a proportionate share in the land. This UDS ensures that apartment owners are the legal holders of the land, providing rights in common spaces, and the overall property. Partitioning a property involves dividing it into separate, independent units. While a builder may have a majority share, they cannot unilaterally force a partition or redevelopment of independent flats without the consent of all the flat owners. 4. Insofar as the time taken for disposal of the case by lower courts till supreme court, is an enigmatic situation, nobody can predict the time taken at different levels or each level owing to various factors involved in the court cases across India. In cases of disputes or redevelopment, the UDS ownership is vital, as it helps in asserting claims. The builder therefore cannot bring the properties into a partition suit, because it is not maintainable as the properties / flats are already partitioned into individual units",
            "It’s better to first get the feasibility report of the said plan and what is the potential which is likely to be received by the members for the said project. Whether builder is getting all the permissions for the said project before your vacation. If there is a discrepancy then approach Hc in writ petition for the same",
            "As each apartment is owned independently, build is helpless unless he acquires ownership of title through a proper transfer by execution of sale deed. Even one owner by refusing to sale his apartment can prevent builder from proceedings with possession of all complex. It is matter of determination of individual apartment owners that will force builder to settle the matter on terms of apartment owners/Dos. Hold your ground, he will come on knees."

I was provided visiting right. #2 Case 2 : Through mutual consent I got the custody of my son back in Nov 18, 2023. My ex husband was provided the visiting right. Current Case : My ex has now objected the custody provided to me on Case 2 and asking to give back the custody. This case was initiated right after 2-3 months of me getting custody. Question: Its been quite long that no result of case has been issued. I am a Canadian citizen and haven't remarried yet. My son lives with my parents since I was provided the custody and I visit him every 6 months ( live for 3-4 weeks). He is going to well reputed CBSE school along with going to cricket academy and I am sponsoring all his expenses. My ex husband remarried got divorced again and then again remarried and has a daughter with her third wife. I want to bring my son to Canada but unable due to the case as I am not able to make Passport/ Adhar card etc needed to apply for his visa in Canada. Question 1.Is there a way this case can be expedited as it revolves around a minor? I mean can this be transferred to high court from the sessional/family court? Question 2: Does Court take consent of 12 year old minor? My minor has bad influence of my ex inlaws and may incline towards his father's family. Question 3: What is the process to expedite this case considering a minor is involved? Question 4: How much weightage does court give to child's opinion? Question 5: What is the approximate cost for fighting a case in High court? Question 6: What are the chances that this case will be accepted in High court ?",
        "answers": [
            "Thank you for sharing the detailed background. Your case involves sensitive and critical issues of child custody, jurisdiction, and the welfare of a minor, which Indian courts treat with utmost priority. Let me address your queries one by one with clarity and practical advice: 1. Can this case be expedited or transferred to High Court? Yes, it can. Since the matter pertains to the custody of a minor child, you can file a writ petition or transfer petition before the Hon’ble High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India to seek expeditious hearing or direct intervention. Courts are generally receptive to such prayers, especially when custody-related delays are causing hardship to the child. In addition, you can move an application for early hearing in the family court as an interim relief, supported by valid grounds like schooling, documentation delays, etc. 2. Will the Court consider your son’s opinion (he’s now 12)? Yes, absolutely. Indian courts, particularly under Guardians and Wards Act and Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, do take the opinion of a minor above 9 years into account—provided the child is mature enough to understand the situation. However, it is not binding—it’s one of the factors. If there is influence or coaching from any side (e.g., paternal family), the court can direct child counseling or interaction with the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) or a Court-appointed Counselor. 3. How to expedite the case legally? To fast-track the process: File an interlocutory application in the family court for early disposal or priority listing. Alternatively, approach the High Court via writ jurisdiction for directions to the family court to conclude the matter within a time-bound period. You may also mention your difficulty in applying for passport, Aadhaar, or visa due to the pending case, making it a compelling ground for urgency. 4. How much weight does the Court give to child’s opinion? The Court always prioritizes “the best interest of the child” over mere preferences. If the father’s household has past instability (remarriages, divorce), and if the child is in a stable, nurturing environment under your parents, it works in your favour. The court will consider factors like: Schooling, routines, emotional bonding Your financial capability and international opportunities Child’s safety, moral environment, and future stability 5. Approximate cost to fight the case in High Court? A custody-related writ or transfer petition in High Court can range from ₹75,000 to ₹1,50,000 depending on the complexity, urgency, and the lawyer’s experience. However, I tailor my professional charges based on your circumstances and ensure complete end-to-end support, including representation, drafting, and follow-ups. 6. Chances of High Court accepting your matter? Very strong, provided the documentation is proper and the petition clearly shows: Undue delay in lower court Impact on your son’s rights and development Legal hurdles in getting passport or visa Your Canadian citizenship and genuine intent to raise your child in a stable environment High Courts intervene especially when lower courts show delay or when minors’ future is compromised. ✅ Why Engage Me?

            "1. There's no possibility to get the case transferred to high court or any other court. If the delay is inordinate or if he's trying to drag it unnecessarily then you can approach high court with a petition to direct trial court to dispose the case expeditiously. 2. A twelve years old child's opinion will be sought by court with regards to his choice to choose either parent. 3. See the first answer 4. The court will be concerned about the child's welfare. 5. You cannot get this case transferred to high court. 6. There's no provision in law for high court to try the case directly.",
            "Case cannot be transferred to HC 2) you can make application to court that you may be permitted to take son to Canada fir his future career prospects 3) seek short dates 4) court considers wishes of 12 year old son 5) legal fees depend upon lawyer engaged by you",
            "1. For expediting the trial you need to file case before the high court for necessary direction. 2. Court can give reliance on the wish of the child after talking to him. 3. File application in high court for speedy trial. 4. Much. 5. It varies with advocates/ 6. Huge.",
            "Speed‑up / transfer? File an “early‑hearing” or “expedited disposal” motion in the family court first; if delay persists, move the Punjab & Haryana HC under Art. 227 CPC/Art. 226 to direct a time‑bound decision or to withdraw the case to itself. Child’s wishes? Yes, courts usually interview children ≥ 9‑10 yrs; a 12‑year‑old’s preference is heard but not conclusive. How to expedite? Urgency motion → if refused or ignored, writ petition in HC citing welfare of minor and pending passport/visa issues. Weight of opinion? One of several factors; welfare, stability, schooling, and each parent’s conduct outweigh a child’s momentary choice. Chances HC will entertain? Good where delay affects a minor’s welfare; HC regularly issues time‑bound directions or takes the matter on its own file."

        "full_text": "Dispute over transportation fees of my child. Background: My wife and me are living separately from more 1.5 yrs. My kid has been staying with her mother currently. I have been boning the school fees and majorly my kid's expenditure. When he stays with her also, I pay the school fees. We recently went into dispute where school transportation of the child was asked to be stopped by me where we are not using the bus facility for more than a year as the kid. I raised this with school, but school refused to remove it as they asked for mother consent. The school is not cooperating, and my wife doesn't want the school bus to be removed Issue: I was advised to put the tuition money amount to my wife's account and ask her to pay the remaining amount is she still ant and I shouldn't be bearing the cost. I transferred the money in her account but then she again started to have an argument transferred me back the mount back. This is to be noted that school only gives a portal where the fees come as in total of tuition and Bus fee Question: a) I don't want myself to hold responsible that I'm not paying the fees but I tried she is not cooperating. This is a pure revenge just getting my money wasted . b) what should be my next step , should i send her the money again and send any mail or seek a reason for sending money back. c) Shall a new account to be opened for this fee amount only and give her details to take the amount of required ? which she may refuse",

You can contact me , if further suggestion needed.",
            "There is no meaning or any purpose solved by paying the transportation fee if the facility is not availed by the student. If you have confirmed that the child is not using the bus facility then you can either issue a legal notice to the school authorities to stop collecting the bus fees or to face the legal consequences for this unfair trade practice. you cannot force your wife to accept the fees, if she has returned that amount you had sent then that becomes an evidence for her refusal to accept the amount paid by you towards the child's educational expenses. If there is no legal dispute between your wife and you and in the absence of any court order directing you to bear the expenses, and despite that, if your wife is refusing to accept the amount towards the fees, you may stop paying them and wait for her to file a petition for child maintenance, you can then demand through court about the details of the expenses and pay them accordingly.",
            "Put everything in writing—today Email the school + your wife: “From the April – June 2025 term I will bear 100 % of tuition (₹ ____). As the child has not used the bus since ____, I do not consent to the transport charge of ₹ ____.” Ask the school to issue separate fee heads or a manual challan for tuition only. Keep the mail and delivery/read receipts—this is your proof of intent to pay. Pay the tuition component through a traceable channel If the portal won’t split the amount, RTGS/NEFT the exact tuition sum to your wife’s bank a/c with the narration “Child — Tuition fee Q1 2025”. Attach the transfer slip to a follow‑up email: “Kindly remit this to the school. Transport charge, if any, is at your discretion.” If she returns the money again, do NOT recycle it Reply once: “Amount returned on ___. I remain willing to pay tuition; please advise an account that will be honoured.” Stop there—your bank statement + emails show that non‑payment is not your fault. Escalate only if the school threatens late‑fee/expulsion Send a legal notice to the school (and copy the District Education Officer) pointing out that Rule 167 of the Delhi School Education Rules allows parents to dispute optional charges. Simultaneously file an application in the Family Court (Guardians & Wards Act s.26 / s.125 CrPC) asking for a clear order on sharing educational expenses. Avoid “new escrow account” unless both sides sign A unilateral account won’t bind her or the school; courts prefer you to pay the service‑provider directly or deposit in court."

I want a divorce from him, since the marriage is almost ended, but he is not ready for a divorce due to the child and torturing me even more. What can i do? How can i go ahead and file for a divorce and what about the child custody?",

            "He needs to rover it in court after the complete divorce proceedings same can’t be used in custody unless proved in court",
            "I understand this is a deeply personal and emotionally draining phase, and I appreciate your courage in taking the first step toward clarity and resolution. Here’s a structured legal insight into your rights and options under Hindu Marriage Law and child custody principles, tailored to your concerns: 🔹 1. Can You File for Divorce – Despite Your Husband’s Refusal? Yes. Under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, you can initiate divorce proceedings even if your husband is unwilling, on valid legal grounds such as: Mental cruelty and incompatibility (Section 13(1)(ia)) Breakdown of marriage with no chance of reconciliation Even though there is a past extra-marital involvement, the court will not prevent you from seeking divorce, especially if the marriage is irretrievably broken and you have suffered emotionally. 🔹 2. Will the Alleged Adultery Impact Your Child Custody Rights? In family courts, child custody is NOT about punishing either parent. The focus is always: 🔸 “What is in the best interest of the child?” Unless it is proven that you are an unfit or abusive parent, your past personal relationship will not automatically disqualify you from having custody or visitation rights. Also: Mere photos, chats, and hotel bookings may suggest a relationship, but may not be enough to conclusively prove adultery in court unless there's concrete evidence like eyewitness accounts or admissions. ⚖️ Indian courts are moving toward a progressive, child-centric view, and do not take away parenting rights purely due to a consensual adult relationship that didn’t harm the child. 🔹 3. Types of Custody You Can Seek You can claim any of the following: Full physical custody, especially if the child is attached to you or still a minor Joint custody, with child residing primarily with you and periodic access to the father Visitation rights, if shared parenting is possible The court also looks into: Child’s age and preference (if over 9–10 years) Stability and emotional comfort of the home Education and upbringing environment ✅ You can also seek interim custody during the case and maintenance for the child under Section 125 CrPC or Guardians and Wards Act. 🔹 4. Practical Legal Steps You Can Take Now Here’s what I recommend as your next move: ✅ 1. Start with Consultation & Case Strategy We’ll draft your divorce petition based on mental cruelty and irretrievable breakdown. You need not file on adultery grounds. ✅ 2. File for Custody Simultaneously In the same family court, you can request interim custody and permanent custody of your child. ✅ 3. Keep All Evidence Ready – Yours and His We’ll organize your records of his mental torture and prepare a defense if he uses your past affair against you out of vengeance. ✅ 4. Mediation Option You can also explore court-sponsored mediation, where terms of custody, separation, and maintenance can be discussed—without heavy courtroom trauma. 📌 Final Word You have the full right to exit a toxic marriage, and courts will not ignore your role as a mother based on personal mistakes if you’ve otherwise acted in good faith and responsibly. Your strength lies in preparing early, legally, and emotionally. Would you like me to assist you with: Drafting your divorce and custody petition Handling anticipatory moves from your husband (including mental harassment or misuse of legal process) Setting up a confidential legal strategy to protect your child’s future and your peace of mind?

        "answers": [
            "Thanks for sharing these important details. From what you've explained, your matter involves a mix of property law under Section 118 of the Himachal Pradesh Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, tenancy issues, and a pending criminal complaint—all of which require strategic legal handling to protect your rights and close this issue permanently. Let me guide you point-by-point: As per Section 118, non-agriculturists require permission to purchase or lease land in Himachal Pradesh. Since you’ve already obtained government permission to purchase the land, your ownership is valid. However, creating a lease deed with a non-agriculturist without proper government permission may technically be seen as a violation only if: It is a long-term lease that amounts to transfer of possession/control, It is considered a disguised sale or permanent arrangement, And if there is irrefutable proof that a formal lease was executed and acted upon. Your defence here will rely on: The nature of the agreement (short-term, non-renewable, no possession rights, and conditional use only after registration), The fact that you initiated registration and NOC was granted by police in 3 months, And that the agreement has no evidentiary strength, as it’s not in his possession, it was partly oral, and was not registered or legally enforceable under the Act. So yes—you can challenge the validity of the lease agreement, or state that it was a conditional licence, not a lease, and certainly not in the nature of transfer contemplated under Section 118. Since: The FIR is pending but chargesheet has not been filed for 7 months, You have a NOC from police themselves to operate the homestay, His possession was conditional and terminated due to breach, You have a strong case that there was no illegal trespass. Police delay in filing the chargesheet may also work in your favour as lack of prima facie evidence. We can even consider moving to quash the FIR under Section 482 CrPC if needed—after reviewing the contents of the complaint. This is just pressure tactics. Now that your homestay is registered, you are legally compliant. I can help you draft a proper reply to the Tehsildar explaining: That there was no valid lease or transfer, That the agreement was not acted upon legally or completed, And that the complainant is trying to harass you after being evicted for suspicious activity. We’ll also highlight the NOC and registration of the homestay to show bona fide compliance. You’re at a stage where everything needs to be consolidated with legally strong, clear replies—before things go against you in record. Based on what you've told me, I can assist you with: Drafting a professional legal reply to the Tehsildar under Section 118, Strategic advice on handling the police FIR and possibly getting it quashed, Drafting a reply to the tourism department to close that complaint, and Preparing future-proof documentation for your homestay to avoid such issues again. Let me handle this properly for you—you’ve already taken all the right steps like getting NOC and registration, now let’s put it all together legally and professionally. Warm regards Contact/WhatsApp No-",
            "It is necessary to peruse notice received by you to advice take the plea that you have not entered into registered lease deed 3) you had entered into notarised agreement but it was never acted upon as full payment was not received by you 4) you are running home stay on the premises and are in possession of the property",
            "Property purchased with proper 118 permission. Lease was unregistered for 11 months, now cancelled. Tenant violated terms, didn’t pay full amount – evicted within 4 months. Police gave NOC; homestay now registered and compliant. Agreement invalid – no stamp paper, signed by wife, not principal party. No intention to violate law; issue now resolved. Request to close matter as there was no malafide intent.",
            "To challenge a complaint alleging violation of Section 118 of the Himachal Pradesh Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, you need to understand the specific provisions of the law and how it applies to your situation. You can then prepare a legal response by gathering relevant evidence. Section 118 generally prohibits the transfer of land in Himachal Pradesh to non-agriculturists without prior permission from the government. Based on your evidence, you can prepare a written response to the complaint, addressing the allegations and presenting your case. As per the provision of section 118 of H.P. Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, 1972 the land purchased by a non-agriculturist after obtaining the permission of Government is required to be put to use within stipulated period for the purpose for which permission was granted. Therefore you may gather evidence to establish the fact that there was no violation in this regard and challenge the same appropriately before the concerned authorities.",

        "full_text": "Can a contempt petition be refiled. I had filed a civil contempt petition against RBI. The matter pertained to certain unilateral post judgement alterations made by RBI in it's circular dt [deleted] to its regulated entities pursuant to the directions issued by the Hon'ble SC on WPC 476/2020. In WPC 476/2020, the Honble SC directed that no interest on interest shall be charged from eligible borrowers who defaulted during the moratorium \"for the period during the moratorium\". However, RBI who was a party to the case altered the judgement directions and issued a circular dt [deleted] mentioning that the honble SC had issued directions that no interest on interest will be charged from borrowers during the moratorium period. On this basis Regulated entities reversed the capitalization during the moratorium but continued to charge for the moratorium from 1st September 2020 onwards although the Honble SC had barred the charge of Interest on interest both for & during the moratorium. My contempt petition 34743/2024 against RBI was heard on 4.4.25 where the learned judges asked me if i was a party to the original WPC 476/2020. When i replied no, they asked me how i was filing the contempt petition. I quoted the judgement in a contempt petition filed in RBI vs Jayanti lal mistry case where it washeld that in terms of general directions, any aggreived person can file a contempt petition and the jurisdiction is not limited to only the parties to the case. The learned judges did not pursue this legal precedent further nor ask me to show the case judgement. They simply went on to ask me if I would like to withdraw my case or if they should put exemplary cost and dismiss it. Given the situation, I was forced to withdraw my case. Now, the order says it is dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to avail applicable remedy under law. They have not specifically mentioned that I have liberty to refile the contempt case. In this scenario, can I 1. Refile my contempt case quoting additional submissions & grounds for refiling explaining why I am eligible to file a contempt petition in view of Girish Mittal Vs Parvati sundaram case page 11&12. 2. If not can I refile the contempt petition with a co petitioner who was a original party to the case. 3. What are the procedural formalities to do it, Do i need to file a SLP seeking permission to refile? 4. Is there a possibility that the court having dismissed the contempt petition as withdrawn will not entertain the contempt petition again now even though the petitioner is now showing evidence of legal precedents which answer the courts concern regarding locus standing of the petitioner affecting maintainability?",
        "answers": [
            "Yes, since your petition was dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to seek remedy under law, you can refile it with better legal backing. Refile with additional grounds – You can include new legal precedents like Girish Mittal vs Parvati Sundaram which supports your right to file contempt even if not a party to the original case. Refile with a co-petitioner – If you include someone who was a party to WPC 476/2020, it strengthens the case and directly addresses the court's concern about locus standi. No SLP needed – Since the case wasn’t dismissed on merits, you don’t need a Special Leave Petition to refile. Court can entertain it again – Courts generally allow refiling in such cases, especially when new facts or precedents are presented and the earlier petition was not decided on merits. Let me know if you'd like help drafting the revised petition or summarizing key judgments.",
            "Firstly before filing the contempt petition agaisnt the RBI, you should have exhausted the remedies before RBI. if the RBI had dismissed or not entertained your request for exempting the interest against interest during moratorium period despite you providing the sC precedent directing the bank to not to charge interest on the interest over the borrowed amount for the period during moratorium then you could have approached supreme court with the proposed contempt petition. Even now you should first exhaust the remedy with the RBI and then file the contempt petition if there is no proper response from RBI",
            "The contempt petition should be filed by petitioner who was party to the original case 2) you should not file contempt petition as it would not be entertained",
            "SC judgments have binding value .court ought to have considered the prudente cited by you 2) if court does not find nay substance in your submissions it can ask you to with draw or impose costs",
            "Your contention is, submissions in support of you case was not heard by the Court and now you again want to appear and argue you case. You are not refiling contempt, you are seeking review of earlier order. There is no such refiling of contempt, fresh contempt can be filed if there fresh contempt is committed.

The limitation period for filing a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell, as per Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 1963, is three years from the date fixed for performance, or if no date is fixed, from when the plaintiff has notice of the refusal to perform. In your case neither the buyer issued any notice to the vendor before the expiry of the time limit expressing his readiness and willingness to buy the property by paying the balance of sale consideration amount. Thus as per law the buyer cannot enforce the registration of sale deed beyond the period of three years. Besides, the property has been developed into a plotted layout and the entire plot have been sold out over the period from the date of development of layout till this date, besides plenty of buyers have even constructed houses in the purchased plots, therefore there is no possibilities for the buyer to turn up at this stage claiming registration of property as per sale agreement and even if he is filing any case, it will not be entertained by court because the buyer was not given possession too at that time. you may proceed with the proposed purchase of property but as a precaution you may obtain a proper legal opinion from an experienced lawyer in the local and proceed only if recommended",

        "full_text": "Urgent complaint regarding marital abandonment, financial neglect, and emotional distress. I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding marriage fraud, financial neglect, and emotional abandonment committed by my husband, who resides in The Colony, Texas and is currently employed at JP Morgan Chase, Plano on an H-1B visa. I entered the U.S. on an H-4 visa on 8th February 2023 after leaving my stable job at KPMG at Gurgaon, India, based on my husband's repeated assurances that he would support my education and career while awaiting his I-140 approval. However, after I made this life-altering decision, he failed to fulfill his promises, abandoned me emotionally and financially and possibly committed fraud for tax benefits. Key Issues: 1. Marital Abandonment & No Communication I had a confirmed return ticket to the U.S. for April 14, 2024, but my husband and his family asked me not to return, without any legal separation or divorce proceedings. He has not made any efforts to communicate or attend marriage counseling despite repeated requests, leaving me in limbo. His actions amount to spousal neglect and abandonment, as I am struggling alone in India, with no clarity on my future or legal rights. 2. Financial Neglect & Sudden Restriction of Access I am still listed on our lease agreement in The Colony, Texas, yet he has not provided any financial support since I left for India. Upon confronting him about a strip club transaction, he immediately changed his Chase bank app password, restricted my access to financial resources, and stopped responding. He previously contributed ₹18,000 INR per month toward my wedding loan EMIs, but stopped payments without discussion after March 7, 2024. I had to take a lower-paying job in Gurgaon due to this situation, significantly impacting my financial stability. 3. Potential Marriage Fraud for Tax Benefits He only communicated properly for one week when he needed my signature for tax filing and then cut off all contact again. He asked me whether to file jointly or separately, suggesting he was strategizing to maximize his tax refund, yet he never informed me of his final decision. His behavior raises serious concerns about whether he married me to benefit from tax refunds and later abandoned me. 4. Substance Abuse & Emotional Distress I was forced to leave the U.S. because of his excessive alcohol and drug use, which was damaging our marriage. On December 31, 2023, during an argument over his drinking, he threatened self-harm, causing severe emotional distress. His substance abuse continues unchecked, and he has made no effort to seek help. 5. Infidelity & Deceptive Behavior When I called for a counseling discussion, I heard a woman’s voice in the background, after which he immediately disconnected and has not contacted me since. On March 28th Friday(usa), I found transactions from a strip club, confirming my suspicions of infidelity. His sister tried to justify his actions instead of acknowledging his deception.",

Here’s what you can do: File a civil suit claiming your share based on your father’s financial contribution and your long-term possession. Request the court to declare the land as joint family property and seek partition. Gather bank records, cheque details, and any proof showing that the land was purchased using your father’s money. Any family records or written communication acknowledging your share will strengthen the case. If you can prove your father paid for the land and it was held in trust for the family, you can challenge your brother’s sole ownership under the Benami law. File an injunction suit to stop your brother from occupying the remaining land until the dispute is resolved.

However if the property was purchased using ancestral funds (money inherited from previous generations), you may have a claim to a share, even if the property is in your brother's name. If the property was purchased using your father's self-earned money, it is considered his self-acquired property, and he can legally transfer it to anyone, including your brother, without your consent. You have not stated whether your father is living or not, if your father is living then you cannot claim any share in the property as right for any reason. If your father had a will and it specifies the distribution of his property, the will will determine who inherits what. If you can prove that your father used ancestral funds to purchase the property, you may have a stronger case for a share, even if the property is in your brother's name. You may need to provide evidence such as bank statements, transaction records, or other documentation that demonstrates your father's financial contribution. You cannot legally get a share of the property if it is registered in your brothers name. The law will consider that the property is owned by your brother."

I lost my mom to death around 1.11 years ago, according to me it was a medical negligence, I do not have any another testimony from the doctors, but there were negligences like 1. Questionable Billing Practices – A sudden, unsolicited 50% bill discount suggests an attempt to cover up negligence and prevent legal action. 2. Systemic Negligence & Loss of Trust – Multiple lapses, including misidentifying patients and withholding information, demonstrate a fundamental disregard for patient safety. 3. Unwarranted Urgency & Misleading Reassurances – Dr. falsely insisted on immediate surgery due to his travel plans and downplayed risks, misleading us into consent. 4. Failure to Obtain Informed Consent – Critical risks were withheld, and my mother was only informed at the last minute, causing panic that directly contributed to her death. 5. Lack of Proper Risk Disclosure – The procedure’s risks were misrepresented, preventing us from making an informed decision, rendering consent invalid. 4. Patient Identification Errors – My mother’s vitals were displayed under another patient’s name, raising serious concerns about monitoring accuracy and patient safety. 5. Lack of Pre-Operative Readiness Assessment – No proof was provided that necessary tests were conducted to determine my mother’s suitability for surgery. 6. Unexplained Deterioration Post-Surgery – She was stable before surgery but immediately placed on a ventilator and lapsed into a coma, with no clear explanation provided. 7. Inadequate Critical Care Facilities – Despite assurances, she was placed in ICU instead of ICCU, revealing a lack of proper infrastructure and negligence. 8. Surgeon’s Absence & Patient Abandonment – Dr. left for his flight post-surgery without informing us, leaving my critically ill mother under the care of others. 9. Unexplained Delay in Releasing the Body – The hospital delayed releasing my mother’s body for five hours without justification. 10. Evasion of Post-Operative Explanation – Dr. promised to explain later but avoided accountability when questioned a month after her passing. Also I am not seeking any kind of compensation at all here I wasn’t given a through understanding of what exactly happened to her in OT, please suggest will these above mentioned points are enough for me to file the case against the doctor or I need mandatorily a testimony stating what exactly was the medical negligence, also it’s going to be 2 years in sometime- will the timeline affect my case(my family was mentally unstable to create this compliant)",
        "answers": [
            "You need the medical diagnostic reports to assess the treatment provided and identify any deviations from the standard of care. 2) you would need Expert medical opinions to establish the standard of care and whether the healthcare provider's actions deviated from it 3) you can approach the State Medical Council for accountability if you are seeking disciplinary action against the doctors and hospital",

            "Yes, medical testimony is highly recommended but not always mandatory. Courts rely on expert opinions to establish whether the doctor deviated from standard medical practices. Without a medical expert, proving negligence becomes challenging, but not impossible. Your allegations (billing discrepancies, lack of informed consent, improper care, patient misidentification, and unexplained deterioration) raise serious concerns. However, to prove negligence legally, you need: Medical Records – Obtain and review all records from the hospital. Independent Expert Opinion – A neutral doctor can analyze the case. Hospital Guidelines & Standard Practices – Compare actions against medical protocols. Eyewitness Testimonies – Statements from nurses, hospital staff, or other patients’ families. Medical negligence cases in Consumer Court: 2 years from the date of incident. Exception: If you were mentally unfit to file earlier, courts may allow a delay. Criminal Negligence (IPC 304A): Generally within 3 years, but earlier is better. Consult a Medical Expert to strengthen your case. File a Complaint in Consumer Court before the 2-year limit expires. Consider a Criminal Case (IPC 304A) if gross negligence is evident. Would you like help drafting a legal complaint?",

We had bought a plot together in Bangalore (upfront payment and no loans) in which I was the sole contributor 2 years before the divorce. Hence we put both our names in the Sale Deed registered at the SRO. Now that I want to have her name removed from the title, my questions are: 1. Does the Divorce Decree suffice to get her name removed from the property as its already mentioned in the Decree (along with the plot details and registeration number) that she would not claim it and does not have any interest in the property. 2. If Divorce Decree is not sufficient, what is the process in details to get her name removed from the title? What would be the overall charges (Stamp Duty and anything else). Also will she be required to be present in-person for this process? 3. If she is required to be present in-peson but is not able to travel to India for the relinquishment deed, can she give a power of attorney to someone in India who is not a blood relative and what is the process of getting a Power of Attorney for NRI as she is outside India?

In such a case, irrespective of the fact that one or both the partners are Indians; the party needs to submit an affidavit by the court of India on a stamp paper signed by a notary and advocate including stating that the parents in India consented and do not have any objection with the marriage. This affidavit is to be produced by the Indian partner only. In the last two decades, the trend of overseas marriages has been increasing at a high rate. Along with this, the brides of overseas marriages have faced a lot of problems which ultimately led to the abandonment by the husbands.

        "full_text": "Can husband force me to give him divorce because of normal fights?. Married in an arranged marriage set up on May 5th, 2024. Both of us got a separate place after 2 months. Things were good for the first few weeks. But then he started to criticize my clothes, my choice of bags, even my opinions and how I spoke. I tried to talk to him calmly a few times how his comments were hurtful but he never thought he was wrong. Even a normal conflict of interest started to become a huge fight and I was labelled as too sensitive, too emotional etc. His mother also interfered a lot even when away and constantly insulted me because of my skin color, my clothes, my jokes, my way of speaking. During conflicts, I got emotional and cried and my husband would walk away. Zero empathy. In anger, I used to shut the door loudly and hit the mattress in anger. I have never harmed myself or him or anyone else. But his and his mom's toxic behavior continued and my reactions were the problem always, never their words. Living separately since Jan 31st, 2025 because he said so. I waited for almost 2 months, no contact for him to call me. Finally I called him on March 14th, 2025 and he said that he will never ever live with me and he will apply for divorce after May 5th, 2025 (completion of 1 year of marriage). And he said he will contest the divorce with all proofs if I don't agree for mutual consent. His mother called me and said I have mental health issues, I am characterless and so many other things. She wants me out of his life. And now he is also behaving the same way. I have the confidence that with proper counselling and no interference from his mother, we will be able to restart our life again and build a strong bond. But he is dead set on never giving this marriage another chance. I feel like he just used me for physical needs for a few months and is now trying to get rid of me. This is a marriage and I respect it's sanctity and want to protect it. I want to know what will happen if he decides to file a divorce case on the basis of these fights and my emotional reactions towards his toxic insensitivity. Please help!",

However you are also right to be cautious about Divorce laws, alimony, and Property rights. So there are vrious things that you have to understand before getting your marriage register either in India or in Singapore. Best option for protecting your Indian property and minimizing the alimony risk is to marry in India under the Hindu Marriage Act or Special Marriage Act and ensures all assets remain in your name or on your name. If you want to marry for loan or homes then marry in Singapore, and consider signing a prenuptial agreement in Singapore to exclude your Indian property from marital status. Keep all your property on your name but it shall not claim the joint ownership. Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask.",
