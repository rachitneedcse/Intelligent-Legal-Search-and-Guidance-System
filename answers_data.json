Alternately it can be registered under Foreign marriage act also. Under this act, the embassy is authorised to solemnize the marriage when at least one party is Indian and the parties are living in abroad. In such a case, irrespective of the fact that one or both the partners are Indians; the party needs to submit an affidavit by the court of India on a stamp paper signed by a notary and advocate including stating that the parents in India consented and do not have any objection with the marriage. This affidavit is to be produced by the Indian partner only. In the last two decades, the trend of overseas marriages has been increasing at a high rate. Along with this, the brides of overseas marriages have faced a lot of problems which ultimately led to the abandonment by the husbands. The bride may be a victim of cruelty or there can be a dowry demand.",

He snaps/shouts/ is too rude to tolerate. He also indulges in sexual favors from prostitutes, which he has confessed to me but there's no proof. I want to finally take divorce and live peacefully in an environment where I am not criticized all the time. My family as well as his knows about his violence and adultery but they are all fine with it, so no one will actually stand by me.

Systemic Negligence & Loss of Trust – Multiple lapses, including misidentifying patients and withholding information, demonstrate a fundamental disregard for patient safety. 3. Unwarranted Urgency & Misleading Reassurances – Dr. falsely insisted on immediate surgery due to his travel plans and downplayed risks, misleading us into consent. 4. Failure to Obtain Informed Consent – Critical risks were withheld, and my mother was only informed at the last minute, causing panic that directly contributed to her death. 5. Lack of Proper Risk Disclosure – The procedure’s risks were misrepresented, preventing us from making an informed decision, rendering consent invalid. 4. Patient Identification Errors – My mother’s vitals were displayed under another patient’s name, raising serious concerns about monitoring accuracy and patient safety. 5. Lack of Pre-Operative Readiness Assessment – No proof was provided that necessary tests were conducted to determine my mother’s suitability for surgery. 6. Unexplained Deterioration Post-Surgery – She was stable before surgery but immediately placed on a ventilator and lapsed into a coma, with no clear explanation provided. 7. Inadequate Critical Care Facilities – Despite assurances, she was placed in ICU instead of ICCU, revealing a lack of proper infrastructure and negligence. 8. Surgeon’s Absence & Patient Abandonment – Dr. left for his flight post-surgery without informing us, leaving my critically ill mother under the care of others. 9.

Without a medical expert, proving negligence becomes challenging, but not impossible. Your allegations (billing discrepancies, lack of informed consent, improper care, patient misidentification, and unexplained deterioration) raise serious concerns. However, to prove negligence legally, you need: Medical Records – Obtain and review all records from the hospital. Independent Expert Opinion – A neutral doctor can analyze the case. Hospital Guidelines & Standard Practices – Compare actions against medical protocols. Eyewitness Testimonies – Statements from nurses, hospital staff, or other patients’ families. Medical negligence cases in Consumer Court: 2 years from the date of incident. Exception: If you were mentally unfit to file earlier, courts may allow a delay. Criminal Negligence (IPC 304A): Generally within 3 years, but earlier is better. Consult a Medical Expert to strengthen your case. File a Complaint in Consumer Court before the 2-year limit expires.

However if the property was purchased using ancestral funds (money inherited from previous generations), you may have a claim to a share, even if the property is in your brother's name.

You have not stated whether your father is living or not, if your father is living then you cannot claim any share in the property as right for any reason. If your father had a will and it specifies the distribution of his property, the will will determine who inherits what. If you can prove that your father used ancestral funds to purchase the property, you may have a stronger case for a share, even if the property is in your brother's name.

        "full_text": "Urgent complaint regarding marital abandonment, financial neglect, and emotional distress. I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding marriage fraud, financial neglect, and emotional abandonment committed by my husband, who resides in The Colony, Texas and is currently employed at JP Morgan Chase, Plano on an H-1B visa. I entered the U.S. on an H-4 visa on 8th February 2023 after leaving my stable job at KPMG at Gurgaon, India, based on my husband's repeated assurances that he would support my education and career while awaiting his I-140 approval. However, after I made this life-altering decision, he failed to fulfill his promises, abandoned me emotionally and financially and possibly committed fraud for tax benefits. Key Issues: 1. Marital Abandonment & No Communication I had a confirmed return ticket to the U.S. for April 14, 2024, but my husband and his family asked me not to return, without any legal separation or divorce proceedings. He has not made any efforts to communicate or attend marriage counseling despite repeated requests, leaving me in limbo. His actions amount to spousal neglect and abandonment, as I am struggling alone in India, with no clarity on my future or legal rights. 2. Financial Neglect & Sudden Restriction of Access I am still listed on our lease agreement in The Colony, Texas, yet he has not provided any financial support since I left for India. Upon confronting him about a strip club transaction, he immediately changed his Chase bank app password, restricted my access to financial resources, and stopped responding. He previously contributed ₹18,000 INR per month toward my wedding loan EMIs, but stopped payments without discussion after March 7, 2024. I had to take a lower-paying job in Gurgaon due to this situation, significantly impacting my financial stability. 3. Potential Marriage Fraud for Tax Benefits He only communicated properly for one week when he needed my signature for tax filing and then cut off all contact again. He asked me whether to file jointly or separately, suggesting he was strategizing to maximize his tax refund, yet he never informed me of his final decision. His behavior raises serious concerns about whether he married me to benefit from tax refunds and later abandoned me. 4. Substance Abuse & Emotional Distress I was forced to leave the U.S. because of his excessive alcohol and drug use, which was damaging our marriage. On December 31, 2023, during an argument over his drinking, he threatened self-harm, causing severe emotional distress. His substance abuse continues unchecked, and he has made no effort to seek help. 5. Infidelity & Deceptive Behavior When I called for a counseling discussion, I heard a woman’s voice in the background, after which he immediately disconnected and has not contacted me since. On March 28th Friday(usa), I found transactions from a strip club, confirming my suspicions of infidelity. His sister tried to justify his actions instead of acknowledging his deception.",

Things were good for the first few weeks. But then he started to criticize my clothes, my choice of bags, even my opinions and how I spoke. I tried to talk to him calmly a few times how his comments were hurtful but he never thought he was wrong. Even a normal conflict of interest started to become a huge fight and I was labelled as too sensitive, too emotional etc. His mother also interfered a lot even when away and constantly insulted me because of my skin color, my clothes, my jokes, my way of speaking. During conflicts, I got emotional and cried and my husband would walk away. Zero empathy. In anger, I used to shut the door loudly and hit the mattress in anger. I have never harmed myself or him or anyone else. But his and his mom's toxic behavior continued and my reactions were the problem always, never their words. Living separately since Jan 31st, 2025 because he said so. I waited for almost 2 months, no contact for him to call me. Finally I called him on March 14th, 2025 and he said that he will never ever live with me and he will apply for divorce after May 5th, 2025 (completion of 1 year of marriage). And he said he will contest the divorce with all proofs if I don't agree for mutual consent. His mother called me and said I have mental health issues, I am characterless and so many other things. She wants me out of his life. And now he is also behaving the same way. I have the confidence that with proper counselling and no interference from his mother, we will be able to restart our life again and build a strong bond. But he is dead set on never giving this marriage another chance. I feel like he just used me for physical needs for a few months and is now trying to get rid of me. This is a marriage and I respect it's sanctity and want to protect it.

Copy of the will Death certificate of the aunt. Any tax receipt showing your uncle/father as the owner. File an execution petition since the lower court upheld the will under Order 21, Rule 35 of the CPC to take the possession legally. and also file the injunction petition for the interference of the siblings into the property.

During our long distance of 1 year, i felt like I deserve to be more happy. We started having arguments over phone regarding finances, and usual matters. She never gave me my space to interact with my family in the last 12 years. She would make it an issue whenever i wanted to go see my mother or brother, while living in india from 2013 to 2016 (before i moved to US with her). During my long distance, i found love somewhere else. I felt special and cared, like never before but i always thought i have to go back to my wife because it wont be possible to leave her. I know i messed it up big time, to agree with IVF, gave my consent, and she came to canada after first trimister. I tried ending relation with the new girl but i couldn't, and when i came to my wife in canada, i was even more sure that my wife and i r not for each other, i confessed everything honestly, she and her family threaten me that they will make life hell for me, and they have abused my family and me. I fear her but i know my happiness is not with her. I dont have a job in canada but i lived with her n last week she delivered a healthy baby. I am trying to convince her for mutual divorce but she is threatening me. Despite knowing that i have had relation with other woman, she doesnt want to let me go. She has been dependent on me for finance n i have realised that my wife needs me but she doesnt love me. Now she is hoping that once i see face of my new born, i will change my mind but i am tired of telling her that i do not want to be with her, i maintain polite tone whereas she goes berserk, using abusive, unacceptable language.

Before his death he signed an agreement with the Landlord that he will get a property of same size in the new building as this building was bieng demolished . In the mean time the builder gave us a temporty shop in the same area to run the busines which we are doing so in the name of the company. Now the builder changed the tenancy in my mothers name in March 2024. I am still running the business in the companys name where my mother is also a partner. Question- 1.Can my mother surrender the tenancy and take money without NOC from me ?? 2.What Happens to satus of the comapny if she surrenders the tenancy as the builder is very powerful and wants the showroom.?",
        "answers": [
            "On father demise you and your mother were deemed tenants as you were carrying on business in said premises 2) mother cannot take money without your NOC as business was run in mane of form and firm was tenant",
            "1. If her name alone is appearing as tenant, your permission with regard to future of the tenancy is not necessary. 2. If the property ceases to exist but the partnership firm will not vanish. The firm can continue with the business from any other place unless the other partner resigns leading to dissolution of the partnership business.",
            "There are two subjects involved here. The first one is rental agreement, which was duly transferred on your mother's name by the developer, may be with or without your consent of NOC since you are one of the legal heirs to the deceased tenant i.e., your father and were doing the same business in the same place with your father before and after his death, therefore your tenancy rights along with your mother's is protected. The second subject is the partnership business which has nothing to do with this tenancy or rental agreement, because the tenancy was on your father's name and subsequently transferred to your mother's name, which was never objected by you till this date. now this business continued in a different location can be shifted to the same place or can be continued elsewhere under the same partnership agreement unless the partnership is dissolved by the force of law on the basis of the circumstances prevailing at that time. Therefore now you can decide that whether you are fighting for the tenancy rights or the partnership business or both and take proper action by due process of law accordingly",
            "Dear client, Your situation involves tenancy rights, business continuity, and potential legal conflicts, so there are various steps that you can take, such as: Since the tenancy was transferred on your mother name so she technically holds the tenancy rights. And if the tenancy was transferred in her individual capacity, she may try to surrender it without your consent. You can file for an injunction to prevent your mother from surrendering the tenancy without proper discussion in the firm. If the tenancy was originally in your father's name as a business-related tenancy, you may have a claim over its continuation under the partnership law. Hope this helps you; if you still have any clarifications or issues, do not hesitate to ask."

        "full_text": "Divyangjan registration with life tax exemption. I am a physically challenged doctor,51 years old, working as a Professor in one of the Medical colleges in Telangana, and a freelance laparoscopic surgeon. I perform surgeries with the help of walking aids. I have emailed and personally submitted a letter to the transport commissioner regarding my car registration as Divyangjan without modification and to extend the life tax exemption for the same in accordance with the G.O of the MoRTH, dated 03 Feb 2023 RT-11036/57/2020-MVL which dictates that \"all the states should register the vehicle of the PWD ownership as Divyangjan if they have benchmark disability of minimum 40% and even if they don't adapt the vehicle as they might hire a driver if not interested in driving or unable to drive. Also extend the exemptions and concessions that are being provided only to the adapted vehicle. This was addressed to all the Principal secretaries of the states and the transport commissioners. After several emails and letters and wait of three months I got a response from the Transport Commissioner's office that Divyangjan vehicle registration is possible even without vehicle adaptation but rejected the exemption of life tax for the vehicle. He also further said that to provide a life tax exemption for the Divyangjan vehicle without adaptation, a G.O. from the Telangana Govt is required. Several emails were sent to both the special chief secretary for transport and roads and to the chief secretary of the state but all are futile. If you google as \" Divyangjan registration\" you can download the G.O. Furthermore the west bengal government implemented the above mentioned G.O. in their state on 29th August 2023 within 5 months after the MoRTH's G.O. was circulated. I bought the vehicle and my TR is going to expire in 10 days and I didn't pay the vehicle's life tax as the case is all about extending the exemption of the life tax for the Divyangjan registered vehicle. I came to know that the TR can be extended but my RTO says \"No\". Can I hire a lawyer to file a petition in the court? Will I win the case? With the petition filed in the court can I drive my vehicle with the temporary registration number plate until the case is resolved? Please answer. Also how long the case is going to run? What would be the lawyer's charge for this writ petition? Actually I am the spouse of the questioner who is a professor and a PhD graduate.",

            "Dear Client, being a person with benchmark disability, you are eligible for registration of vehicle under the Divyangjan category without adaptation, based on the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) G.O. dated 03 February 2023. However, the Transport Commissioner in Telangana has said that life tax exemption for non-adapted vehicles need a G.O. by the state and you could approach the High Court through a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The challenge would be to the inaction of the state in bringing about the MORTH G.O. and seek directions to exempt your vehicle from life tax as per the central directive. You can seek interim relief to permit usage of your vehicle with the TR, until the case gets resolved. The court would most likely grant such relief because it is in conformance with your fundamental rights and provisions of MoRTH for Divyangjan. The length of the case is as per the court's calendar and may take a few months to one year to get a final resolution. Lawyer charges for such writ petitions are usually in the range of ₹50,000 to ₹1,50,000 based on the complexity and experience of the lawyer. The strength of the case gets bolstered, and it acts as a precedent for the other similar issues, making a positive outcome more likely. Consulting a lawyer experienced in handling disability rights and motor vehicle cases is strongly recommended. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",
            "The RTO has categorically refused to grant exemption and seems to have denied the existence of the law you have referred in this regard. If you are confident that you have been denied justice you can approach high court with a writ petition on the basis of refusal of the relief by the authorities concerned by filing the correspondences as documentary evidence from your side. You can enquire about the fees from the lawyer you may engage. The time taken for disposal cannot be predicted.",
            "Yes you can try your luck by filing writ petition HC.",
            "It sounds like you've encountered significant bureaucratic hurdles while trying to secure life tax exemption for your vehicle as a Divyangjan, which is understandably frustrating. Here are some steps and considerations to address your situation legally and practically: 1. Legal Viability of Filing a Petition Strong Grounds: Based on the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) guidelines, you have strong grounds to argue that the state should extend the same benefits to non-adapted vehicles for Divyangjan as to adapted vehicles, especially if those benefits are available in other states like West Bengal. Precedents: The implementation in West Bengal can serve as a precedent, which might strengthen your case. 2. Temporary Registration (TR) Extension Legal Provision: Typically, TR can be extended under certain conditions. Despite your RTO's response, the law generally allows for extensions, especially when registration is delayed due to administrative processes or pending legal matters. Driving with TR: Legally, you cannot drive with an expired TR. You should resolve this either through an extension or by getting the permanent registration done (even if temporarily without the tax exemption) to avoid legal issues related to driving with an expired TR. 3. Filing a Petition Hiring a Lawyer: Given the complexity and specific nature of your case, hiring a lawyer who specializes in disability rights or administrative law would be advisable. A lawyer can draft and file a writ petition in the High Court challenging the decision of the Transport Commissioner's office. Interim Relief: Your lawyer can also file for interim relief to allow you to legally drive the vehicle while the case is being decided. Duration of the Case: The duration of court cases can vary significantly, often taking several months to a year or more, depending on the court's backlog and the specifics of the case. Costs: Legal fees can vary widely. You might expect to pay anywhere from ₹50,000 to several lakhs, depending on the lawyer's reputation, experience, and location. Some lawyers might charge a flat fee, while others could charge by the hour or a percentage of the tax saved. 4. Immediate Actions Consult Multiple Lawyers: Get consultations from several lawyers to understand the potential costs, duration, and likelihood of success. Choose a lawyer who has experience with similar cases and seems most understanding of disability rights. Documentation: Gather all correspondence with the Transport Commissioner, RTO, and any other relevant communications. Also, prepare a detailed narrative of your attempts to resolve the issue administratively, as this will be crucial for your legal case. 5. Continued Advocacy Advocacy Groups: Consider reaching out to disability rights groups and NGOs that might support your cause or have dealt with similar issues before. They can provide both legal resources and additional pressure on authorities through their advocacy efforts. Taking these steps can help you navigate the legal complexities and work toward a resolution that recognizes your rights as a Divyangjan. It’s important to tackle both the immediate legal issues (like the TR extension) and the broader problem (tax exemption) systematically. For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy. Hope you find the information helpful. You are free to contact me for further discussion.

Arun Sharma - AIR 2015 SC 2232, while dealing with the case of visitation right, considered the Black's Law Dictionary, according to which 'Visitation' means a non-custodial parent's period of access to a child. Visitation right means a non-custodial parent's or grandparent's Court ordered privilege of spending time with a child or grandchild who is living with another person, usually the custodial parent. it was also observed that it is a common practice among couples to use kids as pawns in the game of emotional chess. It amounts to absolutely irresponsible parenting to scar children emotionally post separation. The innocent child is being used as tools of vengeance. Although the non-custodial parent is responsible for the care of the child during visits, visitation differs from custody because non- custodial parent and child do not live together as a family unit. I n our opinion, visitation rights have been ascribed this meaning - In a dissolution or custody suit, permission granted to a parent to visit children. Therefore a contempt of court proceedings can be initiated against the wife for refusing to obey a court order regarding visitation rights, as such refusal constitutes willful disobedience of a court order.",

For contempt proceedings to be initiated, the disobedience must be willful, meaning the party intentionally and deliberately refused to comply with the court order. Court orders related to child custody and visitation are considered \"coercive\" or \"injunctive\" orders, meaning they are designed to compel a party to act or refrain from acting in a specific way. you may discuss with your advocate and initiate contempt proceedings in the same court instead of looking for solution through an irrelevant legal forum",

In general, when a suit is dismissed, any interim orders or IA (Interlocutory Application) orders related to that suit, including temporary injunctions, cease to be effective. you may please note that when your rCR case was dismissed . any interlocutory orders, such as those related to visitation rights or other interim reliefs, are automatically dissolved, regardless of whether the dismissal was for default or on the merits. Therefore there is no contempt of court proceedings may be initiated against her because she cannot be compelled to comply with the non existing court orders.

Dear Lawyer, I need legal guidance regarding a legitimate Binance P2P transaction that has now been linked to a cyber fraud case in India. I am an NRI residing outside India and currently unable to visit the police station or cyber crime office in Uttar Pradesh to resolve the issue in person. Scenario: On 8th January 2025, I sold USDT worth INR 50,000/- via Binance Peer-to-Peer (P2P) to a verified buyer who transferred the amount to my Axis Bank account. I conducted due diligence by verifying the buyer’s identity through Binance-provided details and KYC documents, ensuring it was *not a third-party transaction*. After confirming that the sender’s name matched the buyer’s name on Binance, I released the USDT via Binance’s escrow mechanism. I later received an email from Axis Bank’s Cyber Cell stating that a lien (not a freeze) has been placed on the said transaction of 50k on my bank account as per instructions from the Cyber Crime Police of Uttar Pradesh, alleging that the transferred funds were linked to a fraud case. As a NCRP case was filled by the victim (third person) who was scammed by the buyer who purchased USDT from me. I am now considered a Layer 2 recipient in this case since the fraudster (who tok INR from Victim and sent me that INR to buy Crypto USDT) used my Binance P2P order to liquidate stolen funds into crypto. Current Status & Supporting Evidence: I have all supporting proof, including: Digitally signed Binance order receipts for the transaction. Bank statements showing the transaction. KYC details of the buyer (Aadhar/Pan) Details of Binance’s legal portal for law enforcement inquiries Despite my attempts to contact the investigating officer, the provided contact number is out of coverage, and I am unable to get any clarification on the next steps. My Concerns & Queries: 1. Am I legally liable for the fraud committed by the buyer who used my Binance P2P order to buy USDT? 2. Can the police demand that I compensate the victim for their loss, even though I was not involved in the fraud. 3. Can i be arrested? I have just emailed the cyber police with the proofs & a video stmt - but unable to contact them on call as their number is un-reachable (I got their email id & number from NCRP notice sent by my Bank). 4. How do I respond to an upcoming 91/102 Cr.P.C. notice if issued by the police? 5. Since I am an NRI and unable to appear in person, how else can formally communicate my response to the police? 6. What steps can I take to avoid getting dragged into a legal case or unnecessary proceedings? 7. The NCRP case was lodged in UP and my home state in india is Gujarat. I appreciate your time and expertise in this matter. My primary concern is to resolve this quickly without getting entangled in a legal battle, as I have acted in good faith and followed all necessary precautions while trading.

Continue submitting evidence and maintain communication with authorities. Responding to Notices: For Section 91/102 Cr.P.C. notices, submit required documents via a lawyer.

Recently, a few weeks ago, our downstairs neighbor started complaining that water from our potted plants was dripping into her flowerbed area. To address this, we assured her that we would implement a solution by placing a sheet beneath all pots and redirecting the water to our balcony sink. However, she is now insisting that we remove the extension entirely and keep the pots inside. Additionally, although we obtained the builder’s permission at the time of the extension, he is now asking us to remove it. Since our building has not yet been converted into a cooperative housing society, we are uncertain about the legal standing of this demand. This situation has been causing us a great deal of stress, as both the neighbor and the builder are repeatedly pressuring us to remove the extension.

Recitals of the documents wherein it is mentioned that it was joint owned property / co owned by the parties is to be examined and also whether any specific share is mentioned therein is to be looked into. Your 2nd deceased sister's children can claim the share. According to the 2005 modification to the Hindu Succession Act by the Supreme Court, girls are entitled to the same property as their sons. Daughters are granted birthright to their fathers’ or their ancestors’ property under this act. Please note that Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a co-owner of a non-partitioned property cannot transfer the entire property without getting his share determined and demarcated to bind the other co-owners. A partition suit is a judicial action brought before a court of competent jurisdiction to divide jointly owned property. Legal Notice can be sent to the concerned parties at present through Advocate. A legal notice is a formal, written communication that informs the recipient of a legal matter or issue. It is typically sent by an individual, company, or legal representative to another party, outlining specific claims, demands, or intentions. Legal notices are often the first step in resolving disputes or enforcing legal rights before escalating matters to a court of law. It can save time, money and efforts with fruitful discussion on both side. However, if the issue is not resolved, partition suit is to be filed.

Jan 2021 She sent my lawyer notice for maintenance Rs 50000 to her and Rs 30000 each child of two children's. We replied to her notice that we are ready to bring her back. Feb 2021,i filed RCR. June 2021,she file DV against me and parents. Feb 2025,district court has ordered D. V interim maintenance.10,000Rs to each child of two children's and no maintenance / zero maintenance to wife. I have twins children's 1 son and 1 daughter, 7 years old. I am from Pune, wife and children's also stay in Pune at separate residence. My gross income 1,45,000 Per month, in hand 1,05,000 Rs. Her income 49000 Rs at time of filing income affidavit in 2021.After that she changed her job but not updated to court. I submitted her gross income 14 L per anim got by RTI from IT department. But, court not considered this. Court ordered maintenance on 13 th Feb based on my gross income Rs 145000 per month, not considered my in hand salary 1,05,000.And court considered my wifes last company salary 49000Rs, not latest income 14L I have only 5 days to file appeal in session court as 30 days since interim maintenance order is expiring o 12th March My questions: 1 Does 10,000 Rs maintenance for 7 year child living in Pune is reasonable ? 2 Should I appeal to session court to consider my in hand salary and wifes latest income 14L 3 Maintenance arrears are 9L.if I go for appeal in session court, how much % arrears I will have to pay? 4 By appeal to session court can I get stay for interim maintenance? 5 with appeal to session court, how much maintenance would reduce and how much chances?",

            "Dear Client, Your query raises many pertinent questions. The amount of Rs. 10,000 per month for maintenance of each child may be roughly considered the base interim amount in Pune. But you could say that it may not sufficiently cover all expenses concerning education, healthcare, and general living expenditures of the child. If a meticulous analysis of the child's needs has to be propounded, you could expect a revision for it. It might be better to file an appeal keeping in mind that your actual in-hand salary is Rs. 1,05,000 and also bring your wife's current income of Rs. 14 lakhs per annum for the recalculation of maintenance. The revised liability with reference to an arrears of Rs. 9L will depend on what the court calculates the monthly maintenance to be, as there is no preordained percentage for arrears and it all pertains to the fresh order covering the span from the judgment through to the resolution of appeal. You may also seek a stay on the interim maintenance order until the appeal applies. This will be dependent wholly on the direction of the court. However, the amount reduction or increases will be predicated on your proof of actual income and outgoings, bearing in mind the position of your wife that the court judges. You may consult a family lawyer who will give your case a thorough assessment and with whom you will prepare the best appeal to put to the court. I hope this helps. Feel free to inquire for any further legal query.",
            "Legal Strategy to Reduce Maintenance & Challenge the Order Effectively Your case requires urgent legal action since you have only 5 days left to appeal the interim maintenance order. The court has unfairly ignored key financial evidence, making it necessary to challenge the ruling in the Sessions Court. 1. Is ₹10,000 Maintenance for Each 7-Year-Old Child Reasonable? 2. Should You Appeal to Consider Your In-Hand Salary & Wife’s ₹14L Income? ✔ Yes, absolutely. ✔ Your net in-hand salary (₹1,05,000) should be considered, not gross salary. ✔ Your wife’s latest ₹14L salary must be accounted for, as she is equally responsible for the children. Strong Legal Argument: 3. How Much Arrears (₹9L) Will You Have to Pay If You Appeal? 4. Can You Get a Stay on Interim Maintenance by Appealing? ✔ Yes, the Sessions Court can stay the order, especially if: ✔ A well-drafted appeal can reduce the financial burden and delay enforcement of the arrears. 5. How Much Can Maintenance Be Reduced & What Are Your Chances? ✔ With proper legal arguments, maintenance can be reduced significantly, as: ✔ Chance of Reduction: Very High if argued effectively. ✔ Possible Outcome: Maintenance can be lowered by 30-50%. Next Steps – Immediate Legal Action Required Since time is critical, I can: ✔ Draft and file the appeal within 5 days. ✔ Seek a stay on the interim order to pause arrears. ✔ Ensure your wife’s ₹14L salary and EMI payments are properly considered.

While a Will can be contested, it provides legal backing to your claim. Affidavit & Agreement – Your father can execute an affidavit and agreement stating that you have paid for the property and are its beneficial owner. Though not as strong as a gift deed, it can support your claim. Family Settlement Deed – If feasible, a registered family settlement deed can be created where other siblings relinquish their rights. Nomination (If Society Permits) – Some housing societies allow nomination, making succession easier. For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

        "full_text": "Settlement deed. Hi my father in law did a settlement deed about 18 years ago whereby he gave 1/4 of share to all 4 sons and none to his daughter. No One knew about this document . The family has now knocked down the family home and has each got 3 bedrooms for 3 brothers and only 1 bedroom for my husband . In addition to that asx my husband said they have taken from his share and given to his sister as well and my father in law also has a 1 bedroom now . My question is what’s my husband’s legal rights here . As per the deed he should get 1/4 of the land . They only showed us the settlement deed very recently and since my husband is living overseas they have decided to give him the smaller share. Can they change the deed ? I don’t think they have . We need to understand my husbands keg rights pls thanks p.",
        "answers": [
            "Your husband's legal rights primarily depend on the validity and enforceability of the settlement deed executed by your father-in-law. Based on the facts you've shared, here’s a breakdown of his rights and the legal course of action he can take: Right to 1/4th Share – If the settlement deed was legally executed and registered 18 years ago, your husband is entitled to exactly 1/4th of the property, and no one can arbitrarily reduce his share. Deed Cannot Be Altered – Once a registered settlement deed is executed, it cannot be changed or revoked unilaterally unless there was a clause allowing modifications, which is rare. If they have not legally modified the deed, they cannot reduce his share. Fraud & Undue Influence – Since they hid the deed from him for years and are now unilaterally making decisions against the original settlement terms, there is a clear case of fraud and unfair division. He has strong legal grounds to challenge this. Right to Partition – If the family is not following the deed’s terms, he can file a suit for partition in court to claim his rightful share. The court will enforce the terms of the settlement deed and ensure a fair division. Right to Injunction – If the other family members are proceeding with construction that unfairly reduces his share, he can file for an injunction to stop further construction or alteration of the property. 🔹 Send a Legal Notice – The first step is to issue a strong legal notice demanding his rightful 1/4th share and warning of legal consequences if denied. This will put pressure on them to settle fairly. 🔹 File a Partition Suit – If they refuse to comply, your husband can file a suit for partition in the civil court, asking for the court to intervene and divide the property as per the deed. 🔹 Seek Compensation – If they have already taken a part of his share and given it to his sister or father, he can claim compensation for the loss. 🔹 Challenge Any Forged Documents – If they attempt to show new documents modifying the settlement, we can legally challenge them for forgery or undue influence. This is a complex property dispute involving hidden documents and unfair practices. I can help you by: ✔ Reviewing the original settlement deed to confirm his exact legal standing. ✔ Drafting a powerful legal notice to demand his full rights. ✔ Filing a partition suit to enforce his rightful share. ✔ Obtaining an injunction if necessary, to stop any unfair construction. I recommend a detailed consultation where I can review the deed and strategize the best legal action. If your husband wants to proceed, I can assist in initiating the legal process immediately. Would you like to schedule a consultation so we can take the first step toward securing his rightful share? Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

            "I presume Deed of settlement is duly stamped and registered 2) it is binding on all family members 3) you have to file suit for partition to claim your one fourth share in the property",
            "If the transfer of property among his sons was made by your father by executing a registered settlement deed then it is valid and cannot be cancelled or altered suiting any individual's convenience or selfish motives. Your husband can file a suit for partition and claim his share in the property as per the registered settlement deed. Now when the entire property is disputed in the partition suit the other brothers will become scared of losing their share in the property hence there are possibilities for an amicable settlement among everyone, therefore the solution for now is to approach court with a civil suit.",
            "- If the said property is self acquired property of your father-in-law , then he has his legal right to change and give the said property to anyone without taking consent of any of the legal heirs. - However, if the said Settlement deed is registered from the office of Registrar , then he cannot change the same without a court order."

        "full_text": "Online Lottery - House. I am planning to start a business of an online lottery where participants can purchase tickets for a chance to win a real estate property. The lottery will involve selling a set number of tickets, and once the target is reached, a winner will be selected to receive the prize, which will be a real estate property of significant value. Before launching this, I need to understand the legal aspects surrounding such a venture in India.

State Regulations: Which states in India permit such lottery schemes, and which ones prohibit them? Advertising Restrictions: Are there any legal restrictions on running online ads to sell lottery tickets for a real estate prize in India?

            "The main legislative framework, which gives state governments the authority to organize, control, or outlaw lotteries inside their borders, comprises the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998, and the Lotteries (Regulation) Rules, 2010. Because of these rules, lotteries are required to follow stringent regulations to uphold integrity and guard against fraud. However, by addressing the legality of online lottery and the prerequisites for state authorization, the Indian Contract Act of 1872 and the Indian Penal Code of 1860 add even more levels of complication. Although consumer protection laws provide additional protection for lottery players, the legal environment around online lotteries is still complex and differs greatly between jurisdictions. The Indian Penal Code's Section 294A makes it illegal to maintain an office or other location to conduct a lottery without official government authorization. Lotteries need state authorization to lawfully function, and violations can result in jail time and penalties. Lottery participants are protected by the Consumer Protection Act, which guarantees they won't be the victim of unscrupulous business activities or abuse. The legal position on lotteries varies from state to state, necessitating compliance with a thorough grasp of local laws. In several Indian states, lotteries are allowed The states and UTs where lottery is banned in India are: Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Ladakh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Odisha, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Telangana Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Lakshadweep, Delhi, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Online lottery is not illegal in India and was obviously never referred to in the Public Gambling Act of 1867. Although some states have specifically legalised online lottery sales through the state provider most Indian state legislation does not specifically refer to online lottery ticket sales",
            "Dear Client, Running an online lottery for real estate in India falls under the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998, where only state governments can organize lotteries. Private lotteries mainly remain banned, and such a venture may need legal guidance with variations in the laws of the state, with some states like Maharashtra, Kerala, and West Bengal allowing for government-run lotteries whereas others ban them altogether. Under the Consumer Protection Act and the Cable television Network Rules, 1994, advertising online for lotteries is restricted. Consumer protection laws require transparency in ticket sales and in the conduct of lucky draws, to prevent a possible case of unfair trade practice against the company. Tax implications on ticket sales may also arise, with the supplier being liable to pay 18% GST on ticket sales and capital gains tax becoming applicable for winner(s) on property transferred. A lottery license shall be obtained from the Government, and the winner may be required to provide KYC details and comply with seal duties before claiming prizes. Hope this helps. Feel free to ask for any more legal questions."

However, you must have the firm registered with the appropriate authorities and approve their operation by the stock exchanges like NSE or BSE. You also have to comply with other requirements: compliance with SEBI regulations, GST registration if applicable, and having a trading account with a registered broker. If you opt for a partnership, you should have a partnership deed that specifically provides for the trading activity. Additionally, one might need to evaluate the exclusion of the application of the professional tax or have audit requirements under the IT Act. Hope that helps. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.",
            "Trading in F&O is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and can be done by individuals or business entities like partnership firms",
            "Yes, in India, both partnership firms and sole proprietorships can engage in Futures and Options (F&O) trading. However, it's essential to understand the regulatory and operational nuances associated with each business structure. Sole Proprietorship: As a sole proprietor, you can trade F&O in your name. The profits or losses from such trading are considered non-speculative business income under Section 43(5) of the Income Tax Act and should be reported under \"Income from Business or Profession\" in your Income Tax Return. Partnership Firm: A partnership firm can also participate in F&O trading. While a partnership firm is not a separate legal entity, it can hold shares in the names of its partners, either individually or jointly. The income from F&O trading would be treated as business income for the firm and taxed accordingly. Alternative Structures: Some traders consider forming a One Person Company (OPC) or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) to engage in F&O trading. These structures can offer benefits like limited liability and potential tax advantages. However, they also come with increased compliance requirements. Regulatory Considerations: It's crucial to ensure compliance with the regulations set by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the respective stock exchanges. This includes meeting eligibility criteria and adhering to any restrictions on trading activities. Tax Implications: Regardless of the business structure, income from F&O trading is treated as business income. Proper accounting and timely tax return filings are essential to remain compliant and avoid penalties. In summary, both sole proprietorships and partnership firms can engage in F&O trading in India. However, each structure has its own set of regulatory, tax, and compliance considerations that should be carefully evaluated before proceeding.",
            "Yes, you can trade in Futures & Options (F&O) through a proprietorship or a partnership firm in India, subject to regulatory and tax considerations. To do so, you must open a trading and demat account in the firm’s name with a SEBI-registered stockbroker. A proprietorship firm requires minimal documentation, while a partnership firm needs a registered partnership deed specifying F&O trading as a business activity. From a taxation perspective, F&O income is treated as business income. In a proprietorship, it is taxed as per individual slab rates, whereas a partnership firm is taxed at a flat 30% on profits. Additionally, a tax audit is mandatory if turnover exceeds ₹10 crore or if profits are below 6% of turnover. While GST registration is needed if total turnover exceeds ₹20 lakh, F&O trading itself does not attract GST. For compliance, a proprietorship firm operates under the owner's PAN, whereas a partnership firm requires a separate PAN, GST (if applicable), and a current bank account. If you prefer simplicity and full control, a proprietorship is a better choice. However, if multiple partners are involved, a partnership firm offers a structured approach with shared liability. LLPs and private limited companies can also trade in F&O but involve higher compliance costs under MCA regulations. To set up a proprietorship, you need a current account and a trading account linked to it. For a partnership firm, you must register the firm, draft a partnership deed, obtain a PAN, and open a current account before starting trading. Given the legal and tax implications, choosing the right structure depends on your trading volume and compliance preference. Let me know if you need assistance in setting up a firm or drafting the necessary documents."

            "As you know that the Court cannot make a decision without first informing the caveator. It safeguards the caveator's right to be heard in court. Now, the Govt. has already filed the SLP against the judgement passed by the High Court, however, the defects are not cleared since almost 8 months. In any case, caveat have a limited shelf-life of 90 days. If the defects are not removed within 28 days, an application seeking condonation of delay in refiling has to be filed along with the SLP. Once the defects are removed, the SA sends the SLP to the branch officer (BO). This process is called verification. At this stage, the BO scrutinizes whether the case is in order and prepares an office report which also states whether any other identical or similar case is pending before the Supreme Court. He also enters the section or provision of law which the SLP is concerned with. The Registry checks if a caveat has been filed. The AOR has to serve the caveator and give proof of service to the Registry, in order for the SLP to be considered defect free. Once the Branch Officer is satisfied that all defects are removed and that the SLP is in order, he registers the case i.e. he enters the details of the SLP on his computer. A defect free SLP is listed by the listing branch typically within 1 week. Also, please note that anytime soon the SLP (with defects) will be listed. If the defects are not removed till 90 days from the date of communication of the defects, the matter shall be listed with Office Report on default before the Hon'ble Judge in Chambers for appropriate orders and then the matter may be dismissed in default (in non compliance of removing defects). The case can also be reopened after the SLP is dismissed in default, after filing the restoration application (with condonation of delay application).

Below is a detailed legal opinion addressing your queries: No, a bank cannot unfreeze the amount on its own unless directed by the investigating authority or the court. Freezing of funds in cyber crime cases is done under Section 102 of CrPC (Power of Police to Seize Certain Property) or as per directions of regulatory authorities like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The victim must ensure that the complaint is registered with the jurisdictional police/cyber cell, and once the investigation is concluded, the funds can be released only through a formal direction by the same authority that ordered the freeze. No, a bank cannot refuse to comply with a court order unless it is legally challenged or stayed by a higher court. If the National Cyber Crime Portal has confirmed the freeze and a jurisdictional court has ordered the money to be credited back, non-compliance by the bank may amount to contempt of court under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. The bank may justify refusal only if: If the bank refuses to comply with the court's directive, the victim can: Banks are obligated to follow KYC (Know Your Customer) norms under RBI Guidelines. If a bank negligently opens accounts for cyber criminals, it can be held liable for: If a bank is found complicit in facilitating cyber fraud, the victim can file a Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court, seeking: Notable case laws include: Since your case involves news reports of bank officials' involvement, it strengthens your position in a writ petition for full recovery and compensation. Filing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) may also expose systemic failures in banking regulations. For further legal action, I can assist in drafting a contempt petition, writ petition, or legal notice against the bank. Let me know how you wish to proceed. Thanks and Regards, Advocate Aman Verma Legal Corridor",

The plan specified an equal distribution of the properties between the two sons' families, with a small portion to a village attendant. Subsequently, my father executed a sale deed in Aug 2023 in favor of the said person.

Missing payments will be reported to credit bureaus, leading to a drop in your credit score, making it harder to get future loans. Before resorting to legal action, the lender may attempt to negotiate with you or offer a settlement option or you can initiate the same from your end. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has guidelines for personal loan defaulters, and lenders must follow a methodical process for debt recovery, including sending reminders and offering restructuring option. Your lender also has to follow the same. If you don't pay back an unsecured loan in India, the lender may take legal action to recover the outstanding debt. This can involve filing a lawsuit against you, seeking a court order to reclaim the loan amount Therefore you may better pay the pending EMI amount and apply for transfer of loan to any other NBFC or bank to avoid further problems.",
            "You need to pay the emi or can buy sometime from bank if your financial condition is not stable. If your account turns NPA bank may initiate action under Sarfesi act against you",
            "Dear Client, As you have a Loan Against Property (LAP) with Cholamandalam (NBFC) and have defaulted on an EMI for the first time because of financial constraints, you must safeguard your rights while dealing with the lender. Here is a legal approach to deal with the situation efficiently: 1. Your Rights as a Borrower No Immediate Legal Action for First Default: Having no single EMI does not necessarily result in legal proceedings. NBFCs must follow RBI’s guidelines and cannot harass or intimidate borrowers. They can only initiate legal recovery after 90 days of continuous non-payment, when the account is classified as NPA (Non-Performing Asset). Protection Under RBI’s Fair Practices Code: NBFCs cannot use coercion, threats, or harassment to collect dues. They must provide written notices before taking legal action. Calling a home-bound father and harassing family members is againstlaw and RBI protocols. Right to Seek Restructuring of EMI: According to RBI's Resolution Framework, the financially stressedborrowers can approach a loan restructuring. The lender cannot deny a Step-Up EMI or Loan Restructuring Request outright. Right Against Public Notice or CIBIL Reporting Without Due Process: NBFCs cannot serve notices on your property or report to CIBIL without going through due process. CIBIL impact only occurs after continuous 90-day default (NPA classification). 2. What the NBFC Can Legally Do? Initiate Legal Recovery After 90 Days of Non-Payment: If you fail to pay 3 consecutive EMIs, they can classify the loan as NPA and initiate recovery under the SARFAESI Act, 2002. They must issue a 60-day demand notice before taking possession of the property. Report Default to CIBIL After Prolonged Non-Payment: If you fail to pay beyond 90 days, they may report your account as NPA, impacting your credit score. A single missed EMI will not immediately affect CIBIL. Reject Balance Transfer Requests in Case of Default: Since you missed an EMI, other banks may hesitate to approve a balance transfer. However, if you clear pending EMIs, you can apply again. 3. How to Protect Yourself? (A) Send a Written Communication to NBFC Immediately email/write to Cholamandalam, stating: You are facing temporary financial hardship but are committed to repayment. You request a Step-Up EMI plan or a Restructuring option. You have put the property on sale and need time to arrange funds. You are willing to pay partial EMIs consistently to avoid default classification. Request a written response to ensure legal protection. (B) Prevent Harassment of Family Members Formally complain to NBFC’s grievance redressal cell stating: Family harassment is against RBI’s Fair Practices Code. Calls to your bedridden father and wife violate collection norms. If harassment continues, you will file a police complaint and escalate to RBI Ombudsman. (C) Ensure They Follow Legal Recovery Steps (If It Reaches That Stage) If you are over 90 days past due: They must issue a 60-day SARFAESI notice before taking legal action. You can still repay during this period to stop property attachment. (D) Keep Your Property Sale/Balancing Transfer Option Open Once you clear the pending EMI, apply for balance transfer with another bank. Where balance transfer is unsuccessful, negotiation with NBFC to restructure for a longer period loan can assist. 4. What to Tell Your Father & Wife? Instruct them NOT to entertain NBFC calls. If NBFC representatives visit home, politely inform them that: All communication should happen directly with you. Harassment complaints will be filed if they continue targeting family. Ask them to keep records of any harassing calls (date, time, and conversation summary) for legal complaints. 5. Next Steps ✅ Step 1: Write an immediateemail/letter requesting EMI restructuring or part payments. ✅ Step 2: Lodge a grievance complaint against family harassment to NBFC’s Customer Care & RBI Ombudsman. ✅ Step 3: If harassment continues, file a police complaint for intimidation and mental harassment. ✅ Step 4: If unable to pay fully, ensure at least partial payments to avoid NPA classification. ✅ Step 5: Seek out balance transfer features or negotiate a longer loan period. Final Advice Do NOT panic—a single missed EMI will not result in immediate legal action or property loss. Document all communications with NBFC to protect yourself legally. Seek balance transfer options after settling overdue EMI. If harassment continues, report complaints to the RBI Ombudsman."

        "full_text": "Legal Advice Needed: Adoption Documentation Concerns After Retirement. Background: I'm a 70-year-old retired police man from a Hindu joint family. I was reportedly adopted by my uncle (Late Sh D. Rai) when I was 2 years old (around 1956). My biological father (Late Sh N. Rai) was my adoptive father's elder brother. All parties involved, including both my biological and adoptive parents, have since passed away. Key Points: Career History: Served in State Police, retired in 2014 as ASI/LDC Throughout my service, my adoptive father's name was used in all official documents Initial recruitment papers and appointment letter listed my adoptive father's name There was/is no mention of either name of my biological or adoptive father in my matriculation mark sheet or Board pass certificate, except my name, DOB, and roll number etc due to the then existing System of the Board. Current Documentation Status: No formal adoption papers available Have a notarized affidavit from my adoptive father stating he adopted me at age 2 Have a supporting notarized affidavit from my aunt All current official documents (Aadhaar, PAN, Voter ID, Bank accounts, pension papers) list my adoptive father's name Family Structure: Part of a joint family with 4 brothers and 1 sister I am the eldest among siblings Was raised in biological parents' home for education while adoptive father served elsewhere Concern: I'm worried about potential future complications for myself and my children due to the lack of formal adoption documentation. My adoptive father's name has been used in all official records throughout my life and career, but there are no formal adoption papers. Query: What legal steps should I take to regularize my adoption status and protect my children from any future complications? Need advice on the proper course of action to ensure legal validity of my adoption.",
        "answers": [
            "For valid adoption among Hindus it is necessary that there should be giving and taking ceremony 2) deed of adoption ought to have been executed 3) After adoption, your original birth certificate should be amended to reflect your adoptive parents as your legal parent 4) in your case there is no record of any formal adoption 4) If official documents are missing, credible witnesses who were present at the adoption ceremony can provide valuable testimony in court 5) in the case of Thavamani vs. The Special Tahsilar (ADW) Devakottai and another, it has been held that in the case Kirhori Lal v Mt. Chalibai [AIR 1959 SC 504] the Honourable Supreme Court observed: \"An adoption results in changing the course of succession, depriving wives and daughters of their rights and transferring properties to comparative strangers or more remote relations it is necessary that evidence to support it should be such that it is free from all suspicions of fraud and so consistent and probable as to leave no occasion for doubting its truth. 6) In the case of a Hindu, long recognition as an adopted son, raises a strong presumption in favour of the validity of his adoption, arising from the possibility of the loss of his rights in his own family by being adopted in another family. In the case of an ancient adoption evidence showing that the boy was treated by relations, including the person who later on challenges the same, for a long time as the adopted son at the time when there was no controversy is sufficient to prove the adoption although evidence of actual giving and taking is not forthcoming.",
            "If can’t regularise the same and your children will not have any legal issues for your being not having proper legal documents for adoption you don’t raise the issue yourself just counter the same legally if it’s raised by anyone",
            "Your adoption is governed by Hindu law expounded by ancient texts as at the time of your adoption neither Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, Juvenile Justice Act nor Adoption Regulations, 2022 were in force. What was required then was only the act of giving the boy by biological father and taking of the boy by adoptive father, no documents were required then. “The giving and receiving are absolutely necessary to the valid adoption. They are the operative part of the ceremony, being that part of it which transfers the boy from one family to another.” This is the law laid down in 1980 by Madras High Court in Ranganayakamma v. Akwar Setti and still valid. But there is some gray area, admitted by you, “Was raised in biological parents' home for education while adoptive father served elsewhere.” Transfer of boy to adoptive family is necessary condition. Proof in favor of adoption far outweigh the proof against it. Documents available are sufficient to demolish andy challenge to adoption.",
            "Dear client: The Supreme Court has ruled that the mere registration of an adoption deed does not absolve a person from proving the fact of adoption. Bombay High Court ruling The Bombay High Court has ruled that if there are other documents which can sufficiently establish the claims of adoption, then an adoption deed is not needed. Like photos with adoptive parents, all ur educational documents and other documents..and where ever ur adoptive parents did signature in ur school, collage or any other documents in. parents signature Calum.. And u can also prepare a Affidavit by declaring about ur adoption by mentioning all details like adoption date , ur age at the time of adoption, and about ur educational documents and other documents which has Father's name ( adoptive Father's name) .. By submitting all these things r sufficient to prove ur adoption",
            "At this stage, since your service records and other personal identity cards are having your adoptive father's name alone, you were recognised as the son of your adoptive father all through your life and to establish the facts, your identity proofs, service records corroborate your status as adopted son of your adoptive father. Besides, you have an affidvit also to prove the adoption hence in my opinion your worries at the age of 70 years in this regard is unnecessary. Your children should not face any problem due to your adoption status."

(I am regretting for not hiring lawyer earlier itself. Already the case is a complex one. I think I didn't follow the usual format while drafting the complaint. I think CA is also not written in usual format, but they are already submitted. and many other issues are coming) Context: I have filed Medical Negligence case in my district consumer forum, without lawyer (due to some personal, financial issues). Chronology of events: Aug 2024: I have filed the complaint along with some medical literature documents. Nov6: Final deadline for filing Written Version(WV) of OPs, but not filed.

After going through the WV of OPs, I felt that they have said some lies and they also criticised medical literature I have mentioned in my complaint. So, I felt that I should submit additional documents for supporting my allegations and disprove the arguments made by OPs in their WV. When I asked the superintendent in court, he said that I can't file rejoinder, but I can file additional documents along with the Chief affidavit. (He didn't say anything about filing IA). So, in the CA, I included extra paragraphs (under the heading: Reply to WV of OPs) countering some points of WV of OPs, and also mentioned additional medical literature. Dec6: Dec10 is the date for filing CA. But our family is going on a trip on Dec7-13. So, the Superintendent said he will submit the CA & additional documents on behalf of me.

Yes, since these documents were not initially filed with the complaint, it is advisable to file an IA requesting permissionto submit the additional documents.

After all of this first we went to the local police station of the house belonging address but they told we can't do anything with civil matters and later then we went and issued a legal notice to our rented house address which came back saying no person in address, so we sent in WhatsApp which delivered which they are not seeing, so we went and pasted the notice on the house door and took a photo with Geolocation camera as a proof of notice given and after few days they came and saw notice issued and asked us for few more weeks to vacate we prepared a written lettered agreement stating you were stayed in our house and you need to vacate by Jan 16th if not legal actions would be taken the lady signed and went and post 16th they are not vacating one or the other reason and only communicating with voice message saying will vacate on that date and when that date appears they postpone and also they have torn the notice letter pasted on door and their phone is switched off nobody is in the home and they have locked the door with their belongings How can we evict them it's already 4 months.

            "Thank you for reaching out. Your concern is completely valid, especially since the judge explicitly prioritized the case and directed a short date for disposal. Let’s address your queries with a practical and professional approach to ensure swift action: Yes, occasional delays in updating hearing dates and orders are not uncommon, even when the judge has directed urgency. Possible reasons include: ✔ Administrative Backlog: The judge may have dictated the order, but the court staff (registrar, bench clerk, or reader) might not have processed it yet. ✔ Pending Signature: The judge’s order might be awaiting final approval or signature before being uploaded. ✔ Technical Issues: The court’s online system may not have updated due to backend delays. ✔ Clerical Oversight: In some cases, if the order was dictated in open court, it might take 24-48 hours for clerical staff to formally enter it into the system. 🚨 However, since the judge stressed urgency, this delay should not stretch beyond a couple of days. Since this is an urgent matter and standard updates are usually posted by the evening of the hearing, waiting too long is not advisable. The best approach is: Yes, if the order has been passed but not updated online, an inspection will reveal the status. Here’s how: ✔ Step 1: Your lawyer must file a simple application for inspection under the respective High Court Rules. ✔ Step 2: Submit the application at the court’s filing section and pay a nominal fee (if required). ✔ Step 3: Upon approval, you or your lawyer will be allowed to inspect the physical/digital file to check if the order has been recorded. 📌 Why This Helps: ✔ Step 1 (Now): Have your lawyer check with the court’s cause list & orders section to see if the update is pending due to administrative reasons. ✔ Step 2 (Within 48 Hours): If no update, approach the registrar/judge’s reader in person to verify if the order is recorded but not uploaded. ✔ Step 3 (After 72 Hours, if needed): File a formal inspection application to access the court file and confirm if the order has been passed. Since your case is being treated as urgent, any delay should be addressed immediately to ensure compliance with the judge’s direction. I can assist in drafting the inspection application or any follow-up legal documents to speed up the process. Let me know how you'd like to proceed, and we can take decisive legal action without wasting time.",
            "The High court may not have uploaded the daily orders even though it has passed the speaking orders. Your advocate may make an enquiry from the concerned court office about the orders passed on that date of hearing and let you know. It is not unusual."

Nbfc not reported to cibil. in such situation , can the nbfc issue notice under 13(2) sarfaesi?",
        "answers": [
            "Dear Client, Thank you for your query. According to the SARFAESI Act of 2002, it is the secured creditor alone who is entitled to issue a Section 13(2) notice. In this situation, since the NBFC availed a loan from a public sector bank under the 90:10 pool buyout arrangement and the loan is reported to CIBIL in the borrower's name by the bank, the NBFC is perhaps powerless to invoke the SARFAESI proceedings unless it has retained a portion of the loan, security interest, or credit risk. Whether the NBFC can invoke SARFAESI depends upon the *specific terms of the buyout agreement, the securitization structure, and whether the NBFC still qualifies as a secured creditor. It is appropriate that you analyze the loan documentation and the assertions made in the buyout here to appropriately determine its lawful position. Hope this helps. Feel free to revert in case any further clarity is needed.",

Under the proposed scheme, an NBFC sells a pool of assets (say, a set of affordable loans or loans in a certain category or geography) to a PSB in return for immediate payment. The SARFAESI Act can be invoked against a borrower even if an NBFC \"pools out\" a loan, meaning it sells the loan to another financial institution, as long as the NBFC originally created the secured debt and meets the eligibility criteria under the SARFAESI Act, including having an asset size exceeding Rs. 100 crore and the loan amount being above Rs. 50 lakh; the new lender can then utilize the Act to recover the debt from the borrower if it becomes an NPA.",

The unusual reporting of the pool buyout loan under the borrower's name in CIBIL does not affect the NBFC's rights to enforce security under SARFAESI, provided all legal conditions are met.

Key Legal Issue: Unregistered Partition Deed (2008) The 2008 Partition Deed is Legally Invalid Mutation Records Do Not Prove Legal Ownership Risk of a Civil Suit for Partition & Cancellation of Sale Deeds Does the Limitation Act Protect You? You have mentioned Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963, which states: 🔴 In Your Case: Thus, Article 65 does not guarantee protection, and the siblings can still challenge the sale in court. Potential Risks If You Purchase This Land ✅ Risk of Litigation: The siblings may file a partition suit demanding their rightful share, leading to a long legal battle of 5-10 years. ✅ Possible Cancellation of Sale Deed: If a court declares that Mr.1 did not have absolute ownership, the sale from Mr.1 to Mr.Y, Mr.Y to Mr.Z, and from Mr.Z to you can all be canceled. ✅ Financial Loss: If a court cancels the sale, you will lose your money and might face eviction from the land. ✅ Encumbrance Risk: The siblings may obtain an injunction preventing any further sale or development on the land, blocking your investment. Legal Steps You Must Take Before Buying This Land Get a Title Verification from an Expert Advocate Get a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from Mr.1’s Siblings File a Public Notice in Newspapers Obtain a Legal Indemnity Bond from Mr. Z Final Legal Advice: Proceed with Caution! 🚨 DO NOT finalize the purchase until: ✔ The title is legally verified. ✔ All legal heirs sign a registered relinquishment deed. ✔ A legal notice is issued inviting objections. ✔ An experienced property lawyer drafts all documents.

            "Rule 8(6) and Rule 9(1) of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 (SI Rules) require that an authorized officer serve a borrower with a 30-day notice before selling their immovable secured assets: Notice to borrower: The authorized officer must serve the borrower with a 30-day notice. Public notice: If the sale is by public auction or public tender, the secured creditor must publish a notice in two leading newspapers. One of the newspapers must be in a vernacular language with wide circulation in the area. The notice must include sub-rule (5) and Appendix IV-A. The purpose of the notice requirements is to: Provide the borrower with a reasonable opportunity to repay the debt Ensure that the asset is sold for a good price Ensure that the borrower's vulnerable position is not exploited",
            "bank should issue both an 8(6) - 30 days redemption notice and a 9(1) - 15 days publication notice if a property is listed for auction for the second time or later 2) The notice period gives the borrower a chance to clear their dues or negotiate with the lender to avoid the sale of their assets. If the borrower doesn't repay the amount within the 30-day period, the secured creditor can issue a sale notice. At that point, the borrower's right to redeem the property is extinguished.",

Additionally, Rule 9(1) requires that, if the sale is through public auction or tender, the bank must publish a notice in two newspapers, including one in the local language, to maximize awareness and promote a fair sale. If the initial auction fails and a subsequent auction is scheduled, a 15-day notice under Rule 9(1) usually suffices, and another 30-day notice is not necessary. This approach provides the borrower an opportunity to repay while ensuring the asset sale is conducted openly and fairly. For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

            "Dear Client, Thank you for shedding light on the details of your case. Given the facts so revealed, the wife may not be able to gain her interests in a mutual divorce without conditions. The husband has Gold and the property, which he is not returning. In general, a mutual divorce is put forth to conclude all disputes, including financial and property relations. Pursuing this further without addressing these issues may hurt her in any possible later confrontation on these matters. The wife can file an application under the Domestic Violence Act for her streedhan (gold and property) to get it back. The law recognizes streedhan to be the exclusive property of the wife, and its alleged unlawful retention by the husband makes her case in favor of a claim for it stronger. Evidence such as bills, photographs, or witness testimonies must be presented to establish that the husband retains possession of the gold and property. This is a very important step to uphold her rightful claims. Although mutual divorce will be speedier, conditions should be added to preserve the interests of the wife over property and financial aspects. In case the husband refuses any settlement, the wife can oppose the petition as filed by the husband and continue with the DVC and 498A cases. Both the cases require evidence to present to the court. It is crucial to avoid focussing on evidence like police complaints and medical reports, giving proof of harassment or abuse. The courts generally remain cautious with the 498A cases; hence it is important to substantiate the allegations. If mutual divorce is impossible because of the husband’s obstinate attitude, the wife can go for contested divorce while continuing with her legal claims. Such cases may take up a long time, but they can compel the husband to a negotiation. The wife may apply for maintenance, posession orders, or other relief under the Domestic Violence Act to meet her in all basic needs. It is necessary to take very firmly a family lawyer who will act in the wife’s interest. Provided a competent and strong legal battle plan and some capacities, the wife can surely set her foot on the roadmap toward reclaiming her property and getting a fair settlement to the dispute. Hope this helps, feel free to consult for any further query pertaining to the same or any other legal query.",

Somewhere in 2013, one of my siblings fell on hard times because of his bad decisions. But my father requested that I help him financially. Since he was somewhat of a rotten egg, I made him sign a deed that he would not claim any stake in any property that father had & included my flat too in it. Fast forward to today, my father and mother are no more. It turned out the father really did not have any significant assets in his name. Now the other two of my siblings are insisting that they have a share in my flat. They say they have some cheques that show the flat was purchased by my father. And indirectly the flat belonged to him. They say the deed that I signed with my brother establishes that they have a right to the flat too. Do they have a legal claim or is it a ploy to extort money out of me ? The flat was purchased for me by my father. The deed with my one sibling was signed only to get rid of any future problem.

Besides it can be proved through your employment details that owing to your employment at various places you permitted your parents and siblings to live in the property till you returned. The indemnity bond you obtained from your brother while financially helping him shows that you helped him at the time of crisis and as a return you have asked him to not to harass you by claiming any share in your share out of your father's property or your own property.

        "full_text": "Resolving property dispute: seeking advice on selling and fair share distribution. My grandfather owns a building in the city with two 1BHK portions. He has five sons; the first three have passed away, and the last two are alive. The youngest son has occupied both portions of the building for nine years. He let his second wife and a female friend live there and refuses to vacate. Despite multiple requests, he demands ₹2 lakhs to leave but hasn’t guaranteed he’ll vacate even if we pay. The other four families (including heirs of the deceased sons) agree to sell the property and share the proceeds equally. However, the youngest son is obstructing the sale, demanding his share and ₹2 lakhs. Partitioning the property is complicated as his portion includes the last pillar, which could make selling difficult. We approached the police for help, but they refused to file a case. To add to this, the fourth son is exploiting the situation and trying to buy out the shares of others at a low price. What are the possible and efficient steps to sell the property and divide the shares without wasting time in court? Also, why might the police be unwilling to assist in this matter?",
        "answers": [

            "1. Send a legal notice to the last son for partition of the property by metes and bounds. 2. If there's no positive response from the last son, file a suit in the jurisdictional Court for declaration, partition and separate possession of the property by metes and bounds. 3. Police are not legally permitted to interfere in the civil case. 4. Take the help of family elders to resolve the issue and let all the legal heirs enter into a Family Settlement Deed.",
            "All co-owners must agree on the terms of the sale. All co-owners must agree on the terms of the sale. Even if one of them do not agree on those terms, the sale of the proeperty will not be possible and one cannot sell it. The Supreme Court ruled in a recent case that the co-owner of an undivided property cannot transfer the entire property without first demarcating their share. According to Hindu law, a property cannot be sold without the consent of other family members, so if you want to sell your family-owned property, you will need the consent of all family members before selling it. Therefore it is advisable that you file a suit before concerned to sell the property through court and distribute the sale consideration amount to the shareholders as per law or you can file a suit for partition. If the property is indivisible then the court may bring the property for auction sale and distribute the sale consideration amount among the legal heirs as per personal law of succession.",

            "While the legal process to validate a foreign divorce decree in India under Section 13 of the CPC is well-established, in practice, executing and enforcing such a decree can often be a tedious and time-consuming task. Indian courts may scrutinise the foreign decree extensively to ensure compliance with Indian matrimonial laws, which can lead to delays and procedural hurdles. Therefore, I usually advise my clients that if it is a mutual divorce, it is far more efficient and hassle-free to obtain the divorce directly in India. This ensures a straightforward and legally binding resolution, avoiding the complexities of validation and enforcement at a later stage. Thanks and Regards, Advocate Aman Verma, Legal Corridor",
            "Hello, To validate a foreign divorce decree in India, especially when the marriage took place in India and was registered under Indian laws, involves a specific legal process. Here’s a concise guide to help you understand how to proceed: Obtain the Original Divorce Decree: First, ensure you receive the original divorce decree or a certified true copy from the Canadian court that issued it. Hire a Lawyer in India: It’s advisable to consult with a lawyer in India who specializes in matrimonial law. The lawyer will guide you through the necessary steps and help in dealing with any legal formalities. File for Execution of Foreign Decree: Under Section 44A of the Civil Procedure Code, a foreign decree can be executed in India if the country where the decree was issued reciprocates legal processes with India. Canada and India have such a reciprocal arrangement. Your lawyer in India can file a petition for the execution of the foreign decree with the appropriate district court in India. Provide Supporting Documents: Alongside the divorce decree, you may need to provide documents that prove your marriage (like the marriage certificate from India), evidence of your and your spouse’s residence in Canada, and proof of the divorce proceedings held in Canada. Verification Process: The Indian court will verify if the divorce decree adheres to the principles of natural justice, if it was issued by a competent court, and if both parties were duly represented. It must also ensure that the decree does not contravene Indian laws. Decree Validation: Once the decree is recognized by the Indian court, it becomes valid in India. The court might issue an order declaring the foreign decree effective in India, thus dissolving the marriage legally under Indian law. Update Marital Status: After the decree is validated, you can use it to update your marital status in government records or for any re-marriage procedures in India. This process can take a few months depending on the complexity of the case, the workload of the courts, and how effectively the proceedings are managed by your legal counsel.

FROM RBI WEB SITE: What does conducting financial activity as “principal business” mean? Financial activity as principal business is when a company’s financial assets constitute more than 50 per cent of the total assets and income from financial assets constitute more than 50 per cent of the gross income. A company which fulfils both these criteria will be registered as NBFC by RBI. The term 'principal business' is not defined by the Reserve Bank of India Act. The Reserve Bank has defined it so as to ensure that only companies predominantly engaged in financial activity get registered with it and are regulated and supervised by it. Hence if there are companies engaged in agricultural operations, industrial activity, purchase and sale of goods, providing services or purchase, sale or construction of immovable property as their principal business and are doing some financial business in a small way, they will not be regulated by the Reserve Bank. Interestingly, this test is popularly known as 50-50 test and is applied to determine whether or not a company is into financial business.",
        "answers": [
            "The Reserve Bank of India has clarified that for a company to be classified as an NBFC, to decide on its principal business, it will have to satisfy the two tests of assets and income. The financial assets should be more than 50% of the total assets (netted off by intangible assets), and the income from financial assets should be more than 50% of the gross income. These tests need to be satisfied for a company to be regarded as an NBFC. 2) you don’t need RBI permission as NBFC",
            "The conditions described by are enabling restrictions. Only a company doing financial activity of more than 50% of assets and income as per the conditions stated is entitled to be registered as NFBC.",
            "A hire purchase business is a business activity of a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC). NBFCs are companies that are registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). A real estate business can be involved in hire purchase agreements for assets other than real estate. Hire purchase agreements are a way to finance assets without transferring ownership. A real estate business can consider hire purchase as a financing option, but it should evaluate the financial viability of the proposal. The option with the lower present value of cash outflows is usually the better choice. The 50-50 rule, or 50-50 test, is a test used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to determine if a company is a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC). The test is based on whether a company's financial assets and income from financial assets make up more than half of its total assets and income. If a company's financial assets are more than 50% of its total assets, it passes the first part of the test If the income from those financial assets is more than 50% of its gross income, it passes the second part of the test If a company passes both parts of the test, it is registered as an NBFC by the RBI.",

        "full_text": "Legal advice on how to handle ex girlfriend case. Hello all, I was in a relationship with a girl for 4 years. But I wasn't able to marry her because I was afraid that my parents won't agree. So we broke up in September for this sole reason ( my girlfriend was not able to come in terms with the decision) and I got married last month to a girl whom my parents decided by arrange marriage. But ex girlfriend was not able to accept my decision and was asking me to stop the marriage somehow. But I proceeded with the marriage without disclosing my past to my current wife. It's then I got to know that my ex was pregnant with my child and had a missed abortion ( miscarriage which wasn't complete, which she too didn't know till December). She had sent the reports to our common friend and I got to know through him. Although she didn't yet communicate with me, Now I'm afraid that she might file a case on me. Is it possible on legal grounds? Can somehow help me how to handle this situation.",

Engage a lawyer promptly to understand your legal position and prepare for any possible claims. Maintain a record of all relevant communications and events to defend yourself effectively if required. If the matter progresses, consider being honest with your spouse to maintain transparency and address any challenges collectively. Handling the situation calmly and with legal guidance will help you navigate it appropriately. Thanks and Regards, Advocate Aman Verma, Legal Corridor",
            "From your contents it appears that your ex girlfriend conceived almost at the time of your breakup with her, hence your paternity is not confirmed. However you may remember that even if you are responsible for her pregnancy, it was a consensual relationship hence you cannot be held liable for breach of promise to marry her while indulging in physical relationship. Despite she is going ahead with any legal action through police, you may first obtain anticipatory bail and challenge her case on merits or arrange for a compromise settlement later on.",

        "full_text": "Calling off a marriage. I would like your guidance regarding a personal matter involving my girlfriend and her arranged engagement. We have been in a relationship for over a year, but due to a conflict, we stopped communicating in November. In the meantime, her parents proposed a marriage for her, and under pressure, she agreed. The engagement was carried out without my knowledge. I only learned about it a month later and subsequently spoke to her. She has since expressed to me that she is not interested in proceeding with the marriage and has communicated the same to her parents. However, her parents are unwilling to cancel the marriage, but she could not take a stand for me in front of her parents because they might emotionally black mail her, We are concerned about the legal and social consequences she might face if she cancels the marriage, including any potential liabilities or pressures from her family or the groom's side. She is a Christian and I'm a Hindu, Could you please advise us on the possible outcomes of canceling the marriage and recommend the best approach to handle this situation?",
        "answers": [
            "Obtain in writing from her that she wants to call off the engagement as she is not interested in marrying you 2) you can then inform her parents that you do not want to marry her 3) in the event any false cases are filed against you rely upon written communication from the girl that she does not want to proceed with marriage 4) both are adults and cannot be forced to marry against their wishes",
            "Unfortunately, many women are suppressed and not allowed to marry as per their choice. I somehow don't agree with your statement, \"She could not take a stand for me in front of her parents because they might emotionally blackmail her,\" for the simple reason that it is an apprehension. I think your girlfriend can take a stand and communicate with the proposed groom & you can also talk to your parents and discuss with your girlfriend's parents and try to convince everybody. There are certainly many stigmas attached to inter-faith or intercaste marriages. The third person forcing a couple to enter a marriage or breakup is, in my opinion, a social evil & outdated mindset. Nobody can force anybody. Legal consequences: There are no specific legal consequences if you go against the family and marry. At the max, the dissenting family might not give you a share in their 'self acquired properties'. Social Consequences: As said above, you might face the stigma but it's out of anyone's control. We need not live our lives to satisfy others, especially when the subject is linked to personal choice and liberty. You both are adults. You can make your own decisions. You both can get married under the Special Marriage Act unless either of you want to convert your religion and get married as per the Hindu Marriage Act or the Christian Marriage Act. As a last resort, get married and seek police protection if you anticipate any threat.",
            "Dear Client, Engagements are not legally binding in India. This means that your girlfriend can cancel it without facing any legal consequences. However, she may face societal and emotional pressures from her family and the family of the groom, especially if some money has been spent or there had been a public announcement. The best way to combat this would be for her to have an open and respectful communication with her parents, focusing on her happiness and the importance of her consent in marriage. An elder or a family member or even a counselor whom your girlfriend can trust can help in discussing these matters. Thus, it is rare that the family of the groom would take legal action unless they could show either financial or emotional harm; nevertheless, it is sensible to stay on good terms and to maintain documentation of communication. If both of you decide to continue with the relationship, you can take into account the social and familial implications of an interfaith partnership. Hoping this answers your question. Please do not hesitate to pose more legal queries. Dear Client, If your girlfriend has rescinded the continuity of the marriage after her engagement, she needs to handle the situation very well, more so because there might be family pressure. Legally speaking, engagement is not a binding thing. That means she can turn down the marriage without any legal implications provided that no financial enticements nor binding agreements were made. If she cannot pursue her relationship with you due to family constraints, it would be better if you genuinely respected her position and DaR her happiness foremost. Especially, she should have a very open and honest communication with her family about it, possibly involving a well-meaning mediator or counselor. After all, an arrangement ought to be after her due comfort and independence without creating further war or distress. Hope this has helped you. You can definitely ask for any other legal queries.",
            "She is at liberty to call off the marriage she cannot be forced to marry against her wishes",
            "The girl can call off the engagement even at this stage. She can inform her parents as well as the would be bridegroom about her affairs with you and her intention to marry only you. Loving and marrying a person of different community or religion is not a social crime especially if she is stubborn about it then any false complaint that may be lodged by her parents will not be entertained or maintainable. You must assure her and give confidence to her and if possible you should convince your parents and ask them to talk to her parents and her too. As you both are major by age and are confident to live without depending on your parents for economic and other needs, you can take a firm decision to get married to her against all oppositions. You can take the support of your close friends and supporting relatives to somehow accomplish this feat. You can also be in touch with an experienced and dynamic lawyer in the local to rescue from any undesirable situation."

I had booked a property under a subvention scheme according to which I paid 10% at the time of booking and then had to pay 10% at the time of possession. Since the project was delayed, it went out of the subvention period and since there was a delay from the Builder, I filed a RERA case with the builder which I won 6 months ago that ordered the builder to hand over the property to me along with interest on the payments made after payment of balance if any. Since there was no compliance by the builder, I approached the RERA again and they issued an Execution notice to comply within 2 weeks. That period too expired last week. Meanwhile, Bank filed a DRT case against me seeking recovery maintaining that the loan is between me and the bank.

Next Step to Get Possession Since Builder Has Not Complied with the Execution Notice File a Contempt Petition Against the Builder: Request a Recovery Certificate (RC) from RERA: Demand Police Assistance for Possession (if applicable): Drafting Service Offer: I can draft a detailed contempt petition or a recovery certificate request that ensures a faster response from RERA. 2. Do You Need to Fight the DRT Case or Can It Be Delayed? Yes, You Must Respond to the DRT Case, but: Seek a Stay on DRT Proceedings: Key Tip: A strong response can delay the DRT proceedings, giving you time to enforce the RERA order. I can draft a comprehensive defense statement for the DRT case. 3. How to Handle DRT Costs Practically Low-Cost Legal Representation in DRT: File a Counterclaim Against Builder and Bank: 4. Manipulating the Case to Your Advantage If you'd like me to take over, I can prepare and manage all the legal documents, including: This ensures all filings are error-free, properly formatted, and aligned with legal precedents.

            "Rera has directed the builder to hand over possession I want to know whether OC for the building is received ? It appears that you have to pay 20% from your pocket, 10% at time of booking and 10% at possession This means the balance 80% would have been paid by the bank under the subvention scheme to the builder on your behalf So you are indebted to the bank for that 80% regardless of the fact that you have not got the possession The subvention scheme is discontinued by RBI and is prohibited. There appears to be some RBI circular for that I would like to see your tripartite agreement to ascertain when your liability to repay the loan is triggered",

        "answers": [
            "In your case, since your divorce was granted in the USA, you will likely need to provide a legal document confirming your single status for your marriage in Vietnam. The Indian authorities may require proof of your divorce decree to validate your single status certificate, even though the divorce was granted in the USA. You can consider the following steps: Obtain an Apostille or Notarized Copy of the US Divorce Decree: Start by getting an apostille or notarized copy of your US divorce decree. This will serve as a certified translation of the divorce document, making it acceptable under international law. You may also have the document translated into English if required by Vietnamese authorities. Single Status Certificate from India: In India, you can apply for a Single Status Certificate from the relevant authority (usually the SDM or Notary). The Indian authorities may accept your US divorce decree as proof of divorce, especially if it is apostilled or notarized. You can clarify the issue with the relevant authority before proceeding with the process to confirm if they will accept the US divorce decree or if you will need to go through additional steps. Consult the Vietnamese Embassy or Consulate: It's important to check with the Vietnamese embassy or consulate about their specific requirements for a single status certificate. They may allow you to submit the US divorce decree or provide guidance on the acceptable documentation for this purpose. In case the authorities insist on an Indian divorce decree, you may need to file a petition for divorce in India. However, this is typically a lengthy and tedious process, and it might not be necessary if your US divorce decree is validated through apostille or notarization. If you face difficulties in the process, seeking assistance from a legal expert in both Indian and Vietnamese law can help streamline the procedure. Thanks and Regards, Advocate Aman Verma, Legal Corridor",
            "Mutual consent decree obtained abroad is valid in India for your re marriage in case the authorities insist, you have to get the divorce decree validated by Indian courts You can file a petition in family court in India for declaration. That The marriage is dissolved. By US decree",
            "1. You are already single by virtue of the decree of divorce passed in your favour by the competent court in USA. 2. Indian Courts cannot re-dissolve a marriage which has been dissolved already. 3. Your fears seem to be misplaced. Having dealt with thousands of such cases of foreign divorce, I see no reason why the US decree passed by the competent court in USA will not be accepted in Vietnam.",
            "You can get your USA divorce decree evaluated and enforced in India. The relevant family court would send summons to your ex-wife and in case she does not appear, will grant exparte divorce decree in your favour.",
            "To get a single status certificate for marriage in Vietnam: Validate U.S. Divorce in India: File a petition in an Indian family court to validate the U.S. divorce decree under Section 13 CPC. This ensures it’s legally recognized in India. Alternative: If validation isn’t practical, file for a fresh divorce in India. This may be challenging if you’re not in touch with your ex-wife. Single Status Certificate: Prepare an affidavit declaring your single status, referencing the U.S. divorce. Notarize it and get it attested by the SDM and MEA, though they may ask for an Indian decree. Recommendation: Validate the divorce in India to avoid rejection during attestation.

        "full_text": "Denial of fundamental rights in pay fixation and undue harassment in infinitely delaying promised pay fixation. I am an ex-defence Officer and joined this PSU on contract basis in 2016 executive Cadre in Grade VI. In 2023, there was an open competition for 12 permanent posts, 6 in Grade VI and 6 in Grade IV all for same cadre and only serving/ retired IAF officers can apply. I successfully competed and selected one of 06 Grade VI officers. I joined on 24 May 23 and I have 08+ continuous service till date. I had same eligibility, same selection process, same work with no concession. In 2016 I was fixed at minimum of scale at 80,000 (against my last drawn pay of Rs. 1,40,000) and reached 95,600 just before re-appointment. However, my pay was refixed again back to 80000 on re-appointment and assured refixation shortly as per company rules. I requested that my pay be retained at atleast 95,600 as I was from the same company, which was not agreed to. I expected that my pay will be re-fixed to last drawn pay as other 05 officers from Defence Services. Hence I applied or refixation of my last drawn pay. All 6 of us receive our respective pension. I am the seniormost among 12 officers in present company. Whereas, pay fixation of all 11 officers were completed within 6 months and they were fixed at their last drawn pay (1,80,000 for Grade VI and 1,40,000 for Grade IV). I expected that I too be fixed at my last drawn pay of 1,40,000 like my peers and even previously retired defence officers were fixed at their respective last drawn pay. However, after nearly 22 months of agonising wait, I was fixed at my pre-contract pay of 96,000. More shocking was that, even for releasing that, they put inhuman condition of getting my DA on pension be stopped. Although all my peers in grade VI also receive pension, no such condition was placed to them. It is a brazen denial of fundamental rights in 3 aspects. 1. Discriminative pay fixation methodology vis-av-vis peers 2 Being paid significantly less than juniors 2 level below me 3. Denying pay fixation methodology extended to all retired officers in the past. The reason given by HR for this disparity is that “All reemployed pensioners will be fixed at minimum of pay”. I protested that how my peers in Grade VI, who are also pensioners, were given their last pay. Illogical and arbitrary reasons were given. But, pay fixation at 96000 was badly required for me as I was badly in debt and they are refusing release that pay, by putting impossible condition of getting my DA in pension is stopped, whereas no other defence officers were asked so. As per GoI policy, DA in pension is admissible as long as last pay is not protected. No such rule is there either at company or in GoI and it is done by highest authority in HR (Director (HR)) who is the CFA. I am totally upset with Director (HR), who took law in his hands, forcing me to forego DA which I am duly entitled to and financially choking unsuspecting hapless employee, thus depriving his right to live etc. Also I want to file a suit against my company for denial of fundamental right",

Here’s how you can proceed to potentially address this issue: Understanding BDA's Role: The BDA has the authority to regulate constructions and ensure land use as per the designated plans. Any unauthorized construction on CA land is likely a violation of these plans. Filing a Complaint: Residents who oppose the construction can file a formal complaint with the BDA. The complaint should detail the nature of the construction, its location, and how it violates BDA regulations or land use plans. BDA Inspection and Notice: Upon receiving a complaint, the BDA is likely to conduct an inspection. If the construction is found to be unauthorized, the BDA can issue a notice to the association directing them to dismantle the structure. Gathering Support: Since the move is opposed by the majority of residents, it would be beneficial to gather as many signatures as possible to support the complaint. This shows a unified stance from the community, which can have a stronger impact. Legal Advice: It may also be advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property or municipal law. They can provide guidance on the legal steps you can take and help draft the complaint to the BDA. Association Meeting: Organize a formal meeting with the management association to discuss the issue and the community's opposition to the construction. Presenting a formal request from the residents for the dismantling of the structure during this meeting might also pressure the management to act responsibly. By following these steps, you can initiate action to address the unauthorized construction effectively, leveraging both the authority of the BDA and the collective voice of the residents.

            "Ask the relatives not to call the couple for any family functions court, would not grant any restraint order restraining the couple from attending family functions it is not your case that a couple have threatened you, and as such no restraint order will be awarded by court",
            "A restraining order can be sought if the couple’s actions cause specific harassment or mental trauma. Here’s the legal position: Grounds for Restraint: File a civil suit citing mental trauma to elderly parents, embarrassment caused in social functions, and repeated disruptions. Evidence like incidents, medical records, and witness statements will strengthen the case. Scope of Order: Courts may restrain them from attending family functions or interacting unnecessarily. However, restrictions like banning property purchases or lineage-related prohibitions are unlikely, as they infringe upon fundamental rights.

            "There's no provision in law to get any restrain order in this regard. You can ignore seeing them or talking to them either personally or in social gatherings. Their marriage falling under sapinda is no doubt invalid but how can you rectify this error.",
            "Under Hindu law, the marriage of cousins (where the bride’s mother and the groom’s mother are sisters) may be valid or invalid depending on the customs and practices followed by your community. If such marriages are permissible under your community’s customs, they cannot be challenged solely on the grounds of disapproval or embarrassment. As for obtaining a restraining order, courts typically intervene only when there is a clear violation of legal rights or a significant threat to life, safety, or property. Embarrassment or discomfort, no matter how genuine, is unlikely to be sufficient grounds for such an order. However, if the couple's actions constitute harassment, cause mental trauma to the elderly parents, or create a public nuisance, you may file a civil suit for an injunction to restrain specific conduct, such as attending family functions or attempting reconciliation. Additionally, preventing someone from buying property near a residence or restricting their movement without lawful grounds would likely not be entertained by the court, as it could infringe upon their legal rights. It is recommended to approach a lawyer with detailed facts to evaluate whether specific actions of the couple could qualify as harassment or nuisance under the law and to proceed accordingly. Thanks and Regards, Advocate Aman Verma Legal Corridor",
            "Their marriage is invalid under Hindu Marriage Act, parties being within prohibited relationship and sapindas to each other. Any one can file a petition in family Court and get the marriage declared invalid. But Court cannot pass any restrain order you are asking for."

Will she be liable for the taxes for Capital Gain and how much will it be . What if she does not have any other source of income . What if she will reinvest immediately on an other property . Also will she have any benefit due to her old age to evade taxes",
        "answers": [
            "Capital gains from property received by gift are calculated based on the cost of acquisition by the previous owner, as per Section 49(1) of the Income Tax Act. 2) The holding period of the previous owner is also considered when determining whether the gain is short-term or long-term. 3) it would attract long term capital gains tax 4) she can reinvest capital gains in purchase of another property within period of 2 years",
            "Your mother-in-law may be liable for capital gains tax if she decides to sell the property, as the sale of property typically triggers tax implications. The capital gains tax depends on whether the property is considered a short-term or long-term capital asset. Since the property was transferred to her less than two years ago, it will be considered a short-term capital asset. In such cases, the capital gain is calculated based on the difference between the sale price and the cost of acquisition (which would be the cost at the time of the gift, i.e., the value of the property when her brother acquired it—₹5 lakh). The capital gains will be taxed at a rate of 15% for short-term capital gains under Section 111A of the Income Tax Act. If she reinvests the proceeds in another property, she may be eligible for exemptions under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act, where the capital gains are exempted if the entire amount is reinvested in the purchase or construction of a new residential property. This exemption is subject to the amount of capital gains, and the reinvestment should be done within a specified time frame (usually one year from the sale or within two years for purchase or three years for construction). Even if she doesn't have any other source of income, she will still need to pay taxes on the capital gains unless she qualifies for exemptions by reinvesting the proceeds. Additionally, old age does not provide any exemption for capital gains tax. However, senior citizens may benefit from a higher exemption limit in other income tax provisions, but that does not directly apply to capital gains tax in this scenario. It's recommended that she consult a tax professional or a lawyer to evaluate her specific case in detail, including the reinvestment options available to her, as tax laws can be complex. Thanks and Regards, Advocate Aman Verma, Legal Corridor.",
            "As the property is held for less than 36 months short term capital gain tax is applicable. Capital gain earned will be added to her income and than tax will be calculated on the tax bracker in she falls. Under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act she is entitled to tax exemption on profit earned if that entire profit amount is used to buy another house. She can buy a new house within 2 years from the date of sale of his previous property or construct a new house within 3 years from the date of sale. Under Section 54 EC she is entitled for tax exemption if the entire capital profit is invested in bonds issued by NHAI that is National Highway Authority of India or REC which is Rural Electrification Corporation. There is a limit to exemption under Section 54 EC and is Rs.50 lakh. In case she can’t find the right property to buy and is unable to come up with a concrete plan in 2-3 years, she still can save tax on the capital profit earned. This can be achieved by investing gains in the Capital Gains Accounts Scheme (CGAS) in any public sector bank. This amount can then be claimed for tax exemption. However, she is required to invest this money within the period stated by the bank else the deposit is treated as capital gain and tax is deducted on it.",
            "If she has not got any notice she can relax otherwise she has to pay capital gain tax only if she earns any income from the same",
            "Your mother is liable to pay the long term capital gains tax from the period of the purchase of the owner who transferred the property by gift deed to your mother in law.

Since we got married, he has been sexting his female colleagues and has been confronted 3-4 times by me. He is a cabin crew and i am an HR professional. He keeps on flying abroad for days and have been caught sexting different female colleagues at different time in these 3 years. Everytime I confronted, he apologized and assured me that it won’t be repeated. But he still lied to me and went with another girl to a personal trip wherein he informed me and his family that he going with his 6 friends and later on found that he went only with her. After being caught this time, he said he doesn’t wanna be with me anymore and want a mutual divorce. I denied for mutual divorce so he has left me at my maternal place and asked not to come back till I don’t agree for mutual. In the meantime, when my family his family relatives and friends are begging him to reconsider and reconcile, he is again avoiding everyone and going with the same girl to another vacation all alone. And he says she is just a friend. I have thought a lot about it and he has said that he doesn’t wanna file for a divorce unless its mutually agreed and we did out of court settlement types and gets separated. Please advise. I do have the screenshots of his sex chats with those random female colleagues and also have proofs that he went aline with this girl this time. But will that matter if he doesn’t file for a divorce and wants me to mutually agree for a divorce",

IMAGINE this - a man with 10 year old relationship is now cheating on you - You sacrificed / compromised in your own way where ever you could. But this thankless - emotionless man of your's does not consider any of those. So, Hard but Good is Separate as soon as possible, give some time to your self / your Carrer and than think to resettle IF YOU WANT TO . However - It is suggested sit down and discuss the terms of financial settlement and separation. You will be suggested to file Dowry / Domestic violence related cases. BUT trust - all of these suggestion / actions too will lead to settlement 3-4 years down the line Hence dont waste money on litigation / Advocates - Better is settle and separate. Best of Luck - God Bless."

Here is the background of my case: I filed for divorce in India over a year ago, under the jurisdiction of the Indian family court. My spouse, in response, filed for restitution of conjugal rights and other related cases in India. Recently, my spouse traveled to the United States and filed for divorce in a U.S. court, despite the Indian court having issued an anti-suit injunction in my favor, preventing her from pursuing parallel proceedings abroad. Currently, the Indian family court has requested my physical presence to record my evidence, but due to a U.S. court order, I am prohibited from taking my 9-year-old daughter out of the state. As her primary caregiver, it is impossible for me to travel to India without violating U.S. court restrictions. Considering these circumstances: Can I request the Indian family court to allow remote participation via video conferencing for recording my evidence? Are there precedents where courts have permitted remote testimony despite objections from the opposing party? What legal steps can I take to request the appointment of a Commissioner to record my evidence remotely?

Willing to by a property in auction by Bank 1 but there is a second charge on the said property created by Bank 2 without having any property under possession or obtaining NOC from Bank 1.Now what could be my liability towards this second charge created by Bank 2 or how this second charge will be removed from property documents as the auction proceeds will not even cover the secured lenders(Bank 1) debt fully.",
        "answers": [
            "You are not liable to pay second charge dues 2) bank has to approach DRT for recovery of its dues 3) inform the second charge holder that property is being sold . 4) don’t purchase the property",
            "When purchasing a property through a bank auction where a second charge exists, your liability toward the second charge (Bank 2) depends on the extent of the property's sale proceeds and the terms of the auction. Typically, the first charge holder (Bank 1) will have priority in recovering its dues, and if the auction proceeds do not cover its debt fully, the second charge holder (Bank 2) may not receive any payment. However, the second charge remains recorded in property documents until the debt is formally settled or waived by Bank 2. To address this, you should: Review the Auction Terms: Ensure the auction terms specify the transfer of the property free of encumbrances, particularly any subordinate charges. Communicate with Bank 2: Seek clarity from Bank 2 on their willingness to release the second charge after the auction. A no-dues certificate or NOC from them will help clear the title. Conduct Due Diligence: Engage a legal professional to scrutinise the title and check for any potential complications arising from the second charge. Court-Ordered Sale Protection: If the sale is court-ordered, it may extinguish the second charge, but this should be verified explicitly. It is advisable to consult a legal expert to navigate this issue and ensure the title is cleared post-auction to avoid future disputes. Thanks and Regards, Advocate Aman Verma Legal Corridor",
            "It will not be your liability but the first bank liability as it has to provide you good title",
            "Dear Client, Your liability regarding the second charge created by Bank 2 depends on the auction terms. If the property is sold by Bank 1 \"free from encumbrances,\" it is the duty of Bank 1 to clear the second charge and transfer the property with a clean title. If the auction is on an \"as is where is\" basis, you could inherit the second charge and would have to negotiate with Bank 2 for its release or challenge its validity if created without Bank 1's consent. It is of utmost importance to do a proper title search and read the terms of the auction to know the extent of your risks. If Bank 2's second charge is subordinate and the proceeds of the auction are inadequate to pay Bank 1's dues, you may have legal remedies to wipe out the second charge to have a clear title. Tread with caution and seek the advice of a legal expert in this regard.",
            "Dear Client, In case the second charge created by Bank 2 is illegal, as you state, you maypurchase the property through the auction by Bank 1, after proper legal safeguards. Under the SARFAESI Act, the properties are usually sold \"free from encumbrances\", which means the first charge holder (Bank 1) should settle or clear any subordinate charges before transferring the title. If Bank 2's charge is indeed illegal and not validly registered or consented to by Bank 1, it may not legally bind you as the buyer. But the problems would still be there if Bank 2 were to challenge the auction or seek to enforce its second charge. To reduce the above risk, insist that the sale terms specifically provide that the property is sold \"free from encumbrances.\" Also carry due diligence and scrutinize all of the records from title verification down to legal verification for the invalidity of Bank 2's charge. I advise you consultwith a lawyer, who should haveexperience dealing with properties to monitor the sale, documentationprocess. If the title and the auction process are clean, you will not be liable to pay Bank 2 or address its charge. Proceed only after all ambiguities regarding the second charge are resolved to avoid legal entanglements."

        "full_text": "Resolving family property disputes: queries and legal safeguards. Guna, a Hindu male, passed away in 2019, leaving behind his wife Jo, son Senthil, daughter Meena, and mother Poon as his Class I legal heirs. Guna did not leave a will, and his estate consists of self-acquired properties. Subsequently, Jo passed away in 2021 without executing a will. Jo also had self-acquired properties. In 2022, Meena initiated a partition suit against Poon (Defendant 1) and Senthil (Defendant 2) to claim the properties of both Guna and Jo (father and mother). Later, in September 2024, Poon also passed away intestate (without a will). Poon had other children, namely Raja and Shanthi, apart from Guna. Currently, Senthil and Meena are pursuing mediation through the court to resolve the partition dispute. The court has requested details of the legal representatives (LRs) of Poon. Lawyer’s Position: My lawyer advises against producing the legal heir certificate of Poon if the mediation is successful and the case is withdrawn. His argument is as follows: 1. Poon’s legal heirs (Raja and Shanthi) are not entitled to a share in Guna’s properties as poon died. 2. Once a mutual partition deed is registered between the Senthil and Meena, it cannot be challenged after one year by Poon legal heris Raja and Shanthi, 3. Even if Raja or Shanthi files a case later, Poon’s death excludes her heirs from claiming a share. Additionally, Poon’s legal heirs (Raja and Shanthi) are reportedly supporting Senthil . Questions: 1. Is it possible for Poon’s legal heirs (Raja or Shanthi) to cancel the partition deed? 2. After the partition deed, can Meena sell her share of the properties without requiring the consent or signatures of Raja and Shanthi? 3. If Senthil executes a release deed from Poon’s legal heirs after the partition deed, will it be legally valid? Then Is it required Meena to get release deed from Poon’s legal heirs (Raja or Shanthi)? 4. What are the potential positive and negative implications of following this route? 5. If Poon’s heirs later claim a share in Poon’s estate , could that affect the partition deed? 6. What steps should be taken to safeguard against future claims by Poon’s legal heirs after the partition deed is registered? 7. If a legal heir (Raja or Shanthi) decides to challenge after one year, under what circumstances could the partition deed still be contested? 8. If anything goes wrong can Meena file partition deed suit again ?",

            "They can file a suit to set aside the partition deed 2) mutation of properties has to be done in the name of the legal heirs then only can the daughter seller share 3) it is advisable to obtain a release deed from Raja and Shanti 4) court would set aside the partition deed 5) Partition deed can be set aside on the ground that on mothers demise, her other children also had a share in her property",
            "Shanti and raja can claim their mothers share and challenge the partition deed of they were not made parties. This can be only done if the property is not self acquired and inherited: they can only file partition suit once for same property unless withdrawn with liberty to file afresh",
            "There is no mention if Poon had any self-acquired properties. Senthil and Meena as Class I heirs will exclude Raja and Shanthi for inheritance.",
            "1. Yes, Poon's legal heirs have a right to a share out of Poon's share in the property besides deceased Guna's legal heirs towards his own share as one of the legal heirs to his mother. 2. Raja and Shanti have rights over their deceased mother's share in the property hence their consent is essential. 3. Same as above. 4. Poon's legal heirs can claim their share out of their mother's share anytime if they are excluded now by Meena and Senthil hence it is always a legal hassle if they don't relinquish their rights in the property by executing a registered release deed. 5. Yes 6. The partition deed excluding Poon's legal heirs or without they executing a registered release deed will be considered invalid insofar as Poon's share in the property is concerned. 7. The above answer suits this question too. 8. Yes, she will be well within her rights to file a suit for partition.",
            "Poon inherited 1/4th or 25% share in Guna's estate being his class 1 legal heir Poon has passed away, so her properties including her 1/4th share in Guna's estate will devolve on Poon's heirs who are Raja and Shanthi Coming to your questions - 1. The partition between Jo and Senthil will be restricted to their parents' estate only and cannot include any asset owned or inherited by Poon including her 25% share in Guna's estate. Even if it includes it will be voidable at the instance of Raj and Shanthi who are entitled to the estate of Poon including 25% share which Poon inherited from Guna's estate 2. Yes so long as such sale does not affect Poon's 25% share in Guna's estate 3. Depends in whose favour such release is done. If Senthil secures a release in his favour then obviously Meena cannot have any claim over it. If Poon's heirs release in favour of Senthil and Meena jointly then they would be entitled to their respective shares. 4. Cannot work legally in so far it includes Poon's 25% share in Guna's estate 5. The partition deed will be affected only insofar it seeks to deal with Poon's share in Guna's estate 6. What steps ? Meena and Senthil CANNOT deal with Poon's 25% share at all since they are not legally entitled to it. For doing an illegality there cannot be any 'steps' to safeguard against future claims by Raj and Shanthi. Their right in Poon's 25% share in Guna's estate is a subsisting right and so long as it subsist they can seek to work it up any time. Even the bar of limitation will not come in their way. Any transfer by Meena and Senthil of Poon's 25% share in Guna's estate will simply be void as Meena and Senthil would have no right or title in that share in the first place 7. Completely irrelevant and stupid question. Their right is a continuing and subsisting right. So they can work it up anytime. 8. Partition suit for what?? Meena cannot file any partition suit to claim any right in Poon's 25% share in Guna's estate as that share belongs to Raja and Shanthi and NOT Meena."

Surprisingly, during important occasions such as the delivery of our child and other family ceremonies, my wife's biological parents were the ones who were actively involved, not the businessman who claimed to have adopted her. Upon further investigation, I discovered that my wife had not been legally adopted as claimed by the businessman. Despite feeling deceived, I chose to accept this and continued with my marriage. Over time, I noticed that my wife's biological parents were excessively interfering in our marital life. Their behavior was rude and controlling, which led to frequent disputes between my wife and me. Adding to these issues, I discovered that my wife was misusing money and transferring significant amounts to her biological parents. This created further friction in our relationship. Their interference and her financial actions have severely impacted our marital harmony. I strongly suspect that her biological parents were the masterminds behind this entire conspiracy to deceive me into the marriage. Due to the irreparable differences arising from these issues, my wife and I are now living separately, and I have filed for divorce. Given the circumstances, I wish to know if I can file a cheating case under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the businessman, my wife, and her biological parents for deceiving me into agreeing to this marriage based on false claims. Their misrepresentation of facts has caused significant emotional, financial, and personal distress. Would this situation qualify as an offense under IPC 420, and what steps should I take to initiate such a case?",

Include the WhatsApp chats and any other evidence to substantiate your claims. Initiate a Civil Suit for Breach of Trust and Recovery: File a suit for recovery of funds and damages against your partners. You can also seek an injunction to restrain them from further dealing with company assets or executing any agreements with investors without your consent. File a Complaint with the Company Law Tribunal (NCLT): As a director and shareholder, approach the NCLT for relief under Sections 241 and 242 of the Companies Act, 2013, on the grounds of oppression and mismanagement. The tribunal can order an investigation, appoint an independent administrator, or provide other remedies to protect your interests. Inspect Company Records: You have the right to inspect the financial records, agreements, and transactions of the company. Issue a formal notice to the company requesting access to these records under Section 128 of the Companies Act. Legal Notice to Revoke the Agreement on Rs. 100 Stamp Paper: If the agreement stating that you \"got the money\" was signed under duress or fraud, it can be challenged in court. Serve a legal notice to your partners disputing the validity of this agreement and clarifying your continued role in the company. Engage a Competent Corporate Lawyer: Engage a lawyer experienced in corporate fraud and litigation to assist with filing the FIR, drafting legal notices, and representing you in civil and NCLT proceedings.

        "full_text": "Closure of joint home loan after divorce. Hi, I had taken a joint home loan with my then-husband. At the time he fooled me into getting an over-draft type of a loan account. Then when we divorced he executed a gift deed to transfer the ownership of the property to me. Since the beginning I’ve been the only one paying for the loan. I recently found out that even after our divorce and signing the gift deed my ex husband withdrew almost 4.5L from the Joan loan account as this was an OD account. Now I’ve been running behind the bank to give me control of the account as it is wrong that I am the one paying the loan and I’m the sole owner of the property while the other person is still cheating me by secretly withdrawing money from the account. I have frozen the debit on the account but I need your guidance to close this chapter once n for all. I am even ready to close the loan account but the bank says they would need my ex husband’s approval to release the property papers. The bank manager even said that “the bank doesn’t care what is going on in the outside world, we have some rules to follow”. I’m completely broken on how in this age our banks are still following these kind of rules, they want me to reach out to my abusive and cheating ex-husband and ask his approval. My situation is really terrible as I am sure my ex-husband would definitely exploit this opportunity to extort more money from me as now I work abroad. Is there a way where I can close the loan and get my property papers based on my divorce decree and the gift deed. The gift deed clearly states that my ex-husband has no claim over the property.",

Attach the gift deed, divorce decree, and proof of sole loan repayments to substantiate your claim. Send a Legal Notice to the Bank: Engage a lawyer to issue a legal notice to the bank, demanding the release of property papers upon loan closure, citing your sole ownership and the bank's obligation to act within the bounds of law and fairness. Civil Suit for Declaration and Injunction: If the bank continues to insist on your ex-husband's approval, you can file a civil suit in India seeking: Police Complaint for Fraud: Given your ex-husband's unauthorized withdrawal from the overdraft account post-divorce, consider filing a police complaint for criminal breach of trust and cheating under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC. This may also provide leverage in resolving the matter. Closure of Loan Account: Work with the bank to close the account and settle the loan. If the bank persists in requiring your ex-husband’s consent, present the legal documents (gift deed, divorce decree) and escalate the matter to senior bank officials or the regulator.

Consult a legal professional to file a petition if you need to enforce the completion of the registry for getting full legal title and thereby avoiding complications in the future.

The specific actions and procedures may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the by-laws of the society.

            "Yes, a building or society association can take legal action against owners for non-payment of maintenance charges. Typically, the process begins with a demand notice sent to the defaulters, followed by a recovery suit filed under applicable laws, such as the Societies Act or Cooperative Societies Act. The association may also claim interest on the unpaid amount as per the society’s bylaws. If the default continues, a court order can enforce recovery, including attachment of property or assets, and in extreme cases, the court may allow auctioning the flat to recover dues. Some associations impose restrictions on access to non-essential facilities like clubhouses, but essential services such as water and electricity cannot be disconnected. Legal costs for such actions can vary, typically ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹1,00,000 or more, while resolution might take anywhere from 6 months to several years, depending on the case. For other members, such legal action could lead to increased financial burden due to legal expenses and delayed recovery of funds. To minimize costs and discord, the association can consider mediation or arbitration before resorting to litigation and ensure regular communication with members about dues and consequences of default."

        "full_text": "Roof and basement right of original landlord. Hello, TO SUMMARIZE MY QUERY, IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY MENTION IN ANY OF THE SALE DEED (OF ANY OF THE FLOOR OF A HOUSE) OF THE ROOF RIGHT OR THE RIGHT TO CONSTRUCT NEW BASEMENT (DURING RECONSTRUCTION), WILL THE RIGHT TO CONSTRUCT ABOVE THE ROOF AND/OR THE BASEMENT LIE WITH THE ORIGINAL LANDLORD OR WILL IT BE PROPORTIONATE. The same query is explained in a little more detail below In 2007 I inherited the ground floor of a house having a total of 4 floors. All of above floors were already sold off many years back. My sister being the original landlord. The second floor was sold off in 1988 and the top third floor was also purchased by the owner of the second floor in 1993. In both the cases there is no mention of any roof right in the sale deed whatsoever. Since it's a very old house, all the house owners are considering reconstructing the house. Currently no construction is permissible above Basement + stilt + 1 + 3 floors i.e 4 floors in our area. But still a very important question still remains that if and whenever in near or unforeseeable future if permission to construct above 4 floors is ever allowed then in absence of any mention of roof right in the sale agreement of any of the above floors who will have the right to construct if such a permission to construct becomes applicable. Secondly similarly if a basement is constructed during reconstruction then will the right be proportionate or will it be the right of the original landlord (in absence of mention of the basement in any of the above floor sales deed).",
        "answers": [
            "Original landlord has no roof rights. Any construction has to be done as per the sanction plans. Original landlord has no rights on the basement.",
            "In the absence of any specific agreement as to exclusive ownership, everything will be proportionate, including roof rights and basement rights .",
            "It’s proportionate and you need to follow all regulations",
            "Key Considerations: No Mention of Roof Rights: Basement Construction Rights: Reconstruction and Future Construction Rights: Legal Interpretation of Roof and Basement Rights: Roof Rights: Basement Rights: Proportional Ownership:",
            "To address your query regarding the right to construct above the roof and the right to construct a basement in the absence of any explicit mention in the sale deeds, here's a detailed breakdown: 1. Right to Construct Above the Roof: In the absence of any specific mention of roof rights in the sale deeds of the individual floors, typically, ownership of the roof would remain with the original landlord (your sister, in this case). However, it is important to consider the following: Nature of Roof Rights: If the sale deeds of the second and third floors (which were sold to the respective buyers) do not specifically mention roof rights, this usually means that the rights to the roof, including any future construction, remain with the owner of the ground floor or the original landlord. Proportional Rights: In some cases, even if there is no explicit mention, proportionality can be inferred. For example, if the ground floor owner decides to build additional floors above, the rights to the roof could potentially be shared with other owners on the basis of the area they own. However, in the absence of clear terms in the sale deed, such a right is typically assumed to lie with the original owner (in this case, your sister). This would depend on the local laws and regulations, as well as any agreements that may exist between the owners of the floors. Permission for Future Construction: If permission to construct above the 4th floor is granted in the future, and if there is no specific agreement in the sale deeds, the original owner (your sister) may have the right to apply for the construction or decide how the space above the 4th floor is used, unless the other floor owners jointly claim rights to it. 2. Right to Construct Basement: Proportionality: In the case of constructing a basement, the right would typically be proportional to the area owned by the respective floor owners, unless otherwise agreed upon in the sale deed. If the basement construction is not mentioned in any of the sale deeds, it would be treated as part of the overall common property and would be subject to decisions taken jointly by all the floor owners. Original Landlord's Rights: The original landlord (your sister) may have certain rights to the basement, particularly if the sale deeds do not specify the use of common areas or future constructions. However, if the owners of the other floors have been using the land together, they could argue for shared ownership of any new construction, including the basement. Legal Precedent: In general, in the absence of explicit rights in the sale deed, the right to construct would likely be subject to the joint consent of all floor owners. The original landlord may have a claim, but it would be proportional to the shares of the property. This would depend on how the land is jointly owned and local property laws. Recommendation: To avoid future disputes, it is advisable to have a legal agreement or amendment to the existing sale deeds to clearly specify the rights to the roof and basement. This will provide clarity on future construction rights, particularly if the laws change to allow construction above the 4th floor or the addition of a basement. It would be prudent to consult a property lawyer to clarify these issues and potentially draft an agreement that ensures all parties' interests are protected."

        "full_text": "My builder wrongfully cancelled my unit due to miscommunication. Hi, I would like to share few details about the case. To give a small background, i am a first-time home buyer. For each unit there is a dedicated CRM associated to handle any queries, reminders etc. During these 2 years these CRMs have been changed multiple times. Also I had only 2 demands left to fulfil for completion of my unit and there were certain discounts associated with these demands. In last week of September 2024, I got the 2nd last demand letter for which I raised the disbursement request via bank online portal but accidentally forgot that there were few adjustments to be made in this demand for which I met my designated CRM for the unit. They acknowledged that they forgot to adjust the discounts and asked me to cancel the existing disbursement and raise a new one after a new demand letter sent. This whole process was completed on November 28. During this process on the reference ticket I asked them about when will it get completed and the new demand letter, they mentioned that it is in progress and will let me know. I was not clarified and left unanswered about the new demand letter, so i assumed that it would automatically be given once the process is completed. Please note that being a first home buyer such questions are quite valid for me and I was expecting clarity about the next steps from builder's end. Between November 28 & 22nd December 2024, no one from the group including my so called dedicated CRM either chased me or established any communication with me for the payment reminder. Please note that the previous RM and collection agent used to do so(I have proof of everything). First they said I must have been chased or communicated about the reminders by team, when I showed them all proofs they admitted it person that the miscommunicated at first and not send any reminders while also remained clueless about how to revoke cancellation or if revoked then not give the discount on last disbursement due to their company policy. I would like to tell that I had no such intention of withholding money from them instead i raised the disbursement correctly at first time, it was me who initiated the process for adjustment when it should have been done by them in the first place and was only waiting to hear from them about the next steps. I feel mentally harassed by this group as it has affected my work and pretty much everything else. Because of such a poor communication and just for the amount of 6 lakh i was served with unit cancellation. Please help me what legal options do i have if they do not agree and cancel my init or not give the promised discounts(12 lakh rupees) on last disbursement.",

        "full_text": "Encroachment of Common Space and Duct Space on our floor. All of our neighbors have encroached the common space on our floor. Out of the three, two of them have encroached the duct area by converting it into a storage room and then built safety doors to extend their apartment space and the third has taken up about 8-9 feet of the common space and built a large safety door and occupied the space. All of this was done in our absence in 2021 during the peak of the COVID pandemic while we were in another city during the lockdown. When a meeting was held within the housing society around the end of 2021 the committee mentioned that this construction was done without the permission of the society and the committee will not and cannot take any action and told us to take legal action against our neighbors at our end. My parents decided not persuade this matter further as getting into legal action will supposedly incur a lot of time as well as money. Also, during the meeting, the rationale provided by one of the neighbors was that there are other people in the building who had made this and then proceeded to shifting the blame onto us indicating that we are at fault for not allowing them to do so earlier. There were also health issues given by the neighbors as pigeons entered from the duct area and the occupied common area, which frankly makes no sense to us as the windows could have simply be kept closed for dealing with that or a net could have been put as well. Their accusation was we did not allow them to put the net (which isn't true as it was never discussed) which is why they did this. Personally, I am not satisfied with not taking any action and I do wish to take action against my neighbors against this illegal construction after a few years when I have more personal time. In the meantime I had some questions and would appreciate your insights on the same: 1.) Are the committee members of the housing society not allowed to take any action in this case? If so, then what is the point of even having a committee? I found this to be very strange 2.) If legal action is taken by us against our neighbors what is the duration taken to get the justice on this matter? Is it true that it will take several years and alot of money? What would be the range in terms of the costs incurred if legal action is considered? 3.) Are there alternatives to legal action in this case, such as, writing to the fire department, electrical department, municipal committee (BMC) or any other legal body for demolition of these illegal construction? 4.) Is there a set time period by which action is required to be taken after which it is too late? Currently we are too busy with our professional lives to be involved into this matter and would like to take this matter up a few years from now when we are in a better financial and professional position. We expected the society committee to take a swift action but that unfortunately did not work out. I would really appreciate your guidance on this matter. Thank you for your time.",

Validity of Status Quo Post-Impleadment The order dated 13/03/2024 states that \"there be an order of status quo till the amendment is carried out impleading the auction purchaser.\" The purpose of this status quo order was to maintain the existing state of affairs and prevent any prejudice until the impleadment process was completed. The subsequent order dated 19/06/2024 confirms that the impleadment of the auction purchaser was carried out that day. Therefore, the specific condition triggering the validity of the status quo order—completion of the amendment—was fulfilled on 19/06/2024. Thus, after 19/06/2024, the status quo order, as per its plain language, would no longer be effective. 2. Order Dated 09/08/2024 The order dated 09/08/2024 was passed not to continue the status quo but to address the non-compliance by the Respondent Bank with prior directions. Key points from the 09/08/2024 order: This order does not revive or revalidate the earlier status quo order; instead, it deals with procedural non-compliance by the Respondent Bank and ensures the matter is appropriately placed before the Presiding Officer. Conclusion If further clarity or relief is required, you can move an appropriate application before the Presiding Officer in the next hearing."

People rely on hearsay advises. High court is not trial court and high court donot entertain complaint cases as other trial court do. Since judge is involved so situation is required to be handled tactfully. You have badly handled the issue which resulted into worsening the situation. If police is not registering FIR then you can file complaint case also under section 156 (3) cr.p.c. and can also file WRIT in high court. For rest you may consult individually."

        "full_text": "Mutual divorce case is stuck, wife mentally torturing me after I said I can't live with her after her apparent cheating. We married in April 2022 and filed for mutual consent divorce in July 2023. Now she is mentally torturing and blackmailing me. A little background. She was working abroad in gulf before we met in matrimony site and got married. She was having a close friendship with a male colleague. I once found him hugging her when I was not present and had warned her that I will divorce her. This happened same year of marriage. Then in 2023, I found that she went to Bali for a week in her vacation(She was in airline ground services). But it was only few days after going there that I found that she had gone to Bali with that same male colleague. I was working in ship at that time and I didn't have access to internet and only had basic business email facility. I tried hardest to get to tell me the truth honestly but she lied profusely , even swearing in the name of my marriage, her mother and God and saying she went to Bali alone. After two weeks I got internet and I found her messages to him in instagram(I had her login details saved in my tablet). There were signs of an emotional relationship between the two of them which gets stronger once I started confronting her to tell the complete truth with the little proof I had. Finally I decided I cannot take her lies after going through mental torture. I told her I'll file mutual divorce and asked her to home sign. Before that I had also given her one chance to fly to my home within one day forgetting all her job. But she didn't. She finally submitted her divorce papers listening to her mother and sister. I decided to give her a chance by bringing her to my home. But fights soon ensued and she started defending herself. She left to her mother's home in a week. By this time I was mentality exhausted. And I told her to either come home immediately or divorce me as I don't trust her staying in her mother's home and being faithful to me. Eventually she agreed to sign for mutual divorce. But later had second thoughts after being in her home jobless for few weeks. Following this she started begging me on daily basis in my vacation to take her back home. I refused profusely but she kept emotionally manipulating me and gaining sympathy saying she has no father and she trusted me completely. Finally I brought her home just 2 days before going back to ship. She stayed in my home for almost 6 months. When I came back from ship in sep 2024, our mutual divorce case had gone to conciliation stage. After I came from ship.(contd)",

STATE OF KARNATAKA, REP BY ITS PRINCIPAL SECRETARY, REVENUE DEPARTMENT, M.S.BUILDING, BENGALURU-560 001 AND OTHERS. ORDER 1. In this writ petition, petitioner is challenging the order dated 05.07.2016 passed by respondent No.3 Tahsildar,-Davangere.By the said order, the Tahsildar, in exercise of powers under Section 95 of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 (for short, ' the Act '), has directed that the construction made by petitioner herein of a building in the lands bearing R.S.No.58 measuring 3 acres 12 guntas and R.S.No.59/P2-P1 measuring 2 acres 6 guntas situated in Avaragere Village, Kasaba Hobli, Davangere Taluk, shall be demolished after taking necessary approval from the Deputy Commissioner, Davangere District.It is further directed that expenses to be incurred for removal of the structure shall be recovered from the petitioner after obtaining necessary permission from the Deputy Commissioner, Davangere.The Tahsildar has also directed both parties to maintain status-quo regarding the property in question till the dispute with regard to their title and interest over the property in question was decided by the Civil Court. 2. Facts, as narrated in the memorandum of writ petition, disclose that petitioner claims to be the owner in possession and enjoyment of the property in question.He has constructed a building in a portion of agricultural lands allegedly as a farm house.The Tahsildar issued notice dated 17.08.2015 to the petitioner alleging that he had violated the provisions of Section 95 ( 2) of the Act because construction put up by him was not of a farm house, but of a huge building for purposes other than agriculture. 3. An order had been passed on 01.09.2015 in similar terms as has been done now under the impugned order.The same was challenged before this Court in W.P.Nos.41416/2015 & 41784/2015.This Court disposed of the said writ petitions on 01.10.2015 observing that petitioner had to prefer an appeal under Section 49 of the Act. W.A.Nos.4356/2015 & 4524/2015 were filed against the same.The Division Bench of this Court set aside the order passed by the Tahsildar and remitted the matter to the Tahsildar for consideration afresh and directed the parties to maintain status-quo with regard to change in the nature and character of the property in dispute till the matter was considered by the Tahsildar. The Tahsildar was directed not to prevent the petitioner from entering into the farm house already constructed on the land.This is how the Tahsidlar has considered the matter afresh and has passed the impugned order. 4. As per the findings recorded by the Tahsildar, although petitioner had asserted before him that construction put up in the land in question was that of a farm house, report secured by the Tahsidlar from different authorities such as the Assistant Executive Engineer, Public Works Department and the Assistant Director of Agriculture, Department of Agriculture disclosed that size of the construction was 150 X 50 sq.mtrs.and the approximate cost of construction was around rupees twenty two lakhs and therefore, such a building could not have been constructed in the agricultural land and hence, it had to be regarded as illegal construction put up without getting the land converted as required under Section 95 of the Act. 5. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner contends that the Tahsildar obtained report from the Public Works Department and Department of Agriculture behind the back of the petitioner and none of the reports relied upon were furnished to the petitioner to have his say in the matter. He further points out that merely because construction was relatively huge, it could not be contended that it ceased to be a farm house. 6. It is contended that as long as the construction put up is for the purpose of the farmer to enable him to carry on his agricultural activities in the farm land, no matter whether it is a smaller construction or bigger one, it does not lose the characteristic feature of a farm house. 7. Sri S.V.Angadi, learned counsel appearing for impleading applicant in I.A.1/2016 submits that petitioner has been illegally enjoying the property without parting with the requisite share which the impleading applicant is legally entitled as per the judgment and decree passed by the Civil Court.He submits that petitioner is unjustly enriching himself by enjoying the properties including the subject lands with utter disregard to the judgment rendered by the Civil Court. 8. Learned Additional Government Advocate points out that as per Section 95 ( 1) of the Act, erection of building for better cultivation of the agricultural land or for its more convenient use, though permissible, in terms of the proviso to sub-section. (1) of Section 95 of the Act and the explanation appended thereto, the farm building or farm house, so erected shall not be more than 10% of his holding and that farm house or farm building means a house attached to a farm and construction in a portion of agricultural land, used for the residence of the agriculturist or used for the purpose of keeping agricultural equipments and tethering cattle. The house shall be used by farmer for his own use and it shall not be let out for commercial activities to any individual or agency. 9. In the light of the above, I have examined the contentions urged by all the parties and also the entire matter in detail. Sub-section ( 1) of Section 95 of the Act which is relevant for the present purpose can be usefully extracted as under: \" Subject to any law for the time being in force regarding erection of buildings or construction of wells or tanks, an occupant of land assessed or held for the purpose of agriculture is entitled by himself, his servants, tenants, agents, or other legal representatives, to erect farm buildings, construct wells or tanks, or make any other improvements thereon for the better cultivation of the land or its more convenient use for the purpose aforesaid: Provided that the farm Building or farm House so erected shall not be more than ten per cent of his holding subject to maximum of such extent of land as may be prescribed. \" 10. Section 96 of the Act provides for imposition of penalty for using agricultural land for other purposes without permission. Sub-section ( 1) of Section 96 of the Act reads as under: \" If any land assessed or held for the purpose of agriculture be diverted or used for any other purpose without the permission of the Deputy Commissioner, or before the expiry of the period prescribed in sub-section ( 5) of Section 95, the Deputy Commissioner may summarily evict the occupant and the person responsible for the diversion from the land so diverted and any building or other construction erected thereon shall also, if not removed after such written notice as the Deputy Commissioner may deem reasonable, be liable for forfeiture or to summary removal. The occupant and the person responsible for the diversion shall also be liable to pay, such penalty not exceeding one thousand rupees as the Deputy Commissioner may, subject to the rules made by the State Government in this behalf, direct. \" Rule 107- A of the Karnataka Land Revenue Rules, 1966 makes provision for payment of amount for compounding, in case of diversion of agricultural lands for non-agricultural use. 11. It is thus clear that an agriculturist can erect building in his agricultural land for its more convenient use or better cultivation, provided such farm building or farm house so erected is not more than 10% of his holding subject to maximum of such extent of land as may be prescribed. No Rule prescribing any maximum extent of land on which such building can be erected is brought to the notice of the Court. Therefore, proviso which says that the farm building or farm house so erected shall not be more than 10% of his holding has to be kept in mind while examining whether the house constructed is in the nature of a farm house or it loses its characteristic feature of a farm house. In other words, if the farmer has got 10 acres of land, he cannot be found fault with for putting up construction utilizing a bigger area in his agricultural land, say up to 1 acre provided he uses such construction for his own residence for the purpose of agricultural operations, tethering of cattle or for storing agricultural implements or products including for residence of himself and his family members, his servants and dependents. 12. If the agricultural land is so required to be used for erecting a farm house or farm building, then the agriculturist is not required to file an application seeking conversion of land as contemplated under sub- section ( 2) of Section 95. 13. In the instant case, the Tahsildar has proceeded on the basis of the report obtained from the Public Works Department and Department of Agriculture wherein it has been allegedly stated that petitioner had constructed a huge building by spending about rupees twenty two lakhs apparently for subjecting it to commercial use and therefore, it could not be regarded as a farm house. This finding recorded by the Tahsildar is not preceded by a fair and reasonable opportunity given to the petitioner by supplying copies of the reports obtained from the Assistant Executive Engineer of Public Works Department and Assistant Director of Agriculture of Agriculture Department. It is well established that if a quasi judicial authority wants to place reliance on any report which is adverse to the interest of the petitioner, then the affected person (petitioner herein) shall be furnished with copies of such reports and shall be provided an opportunity to rebut the contents thereof. Such a procedure has not been followed in the instant case. 14. Merely because the construction put up is a bigger one, it cannot be held that the construction loses the characteristic of a farm building unless it falls within the mischief of proviso to sub-section ( 1) of Section 95 of the Act which states that such farm building or farm house erected shall not be more than 10% of his holding or that it does not satisfy the explanation appended to sub-section ( 1) of Section 95 of the Act which states that farm building or a farm house means a house attached to a farm and construction made in a portion of agricultural land, used for the residence of the agriculturist or used for the purpose of keeping agricultural equipments and tethering cattle or that the house shall be used by farmer for his own use and shall not be let out for commercial activities to any individual or agency. 15. There is no finding recorded in the instant case that construction put up has been let out either for commercial use to any other person or agency. In such circumstances, the Tahsildar was not right and justified in making an inference based on the structure put up that as the building was bigger one, it could not be regarded as a farm house/building. In addition, the Tahsildar was not right and justified in directing the parties to maintain status-quo till disposal of the civil suit. It is for the authorities to work out their remedies in the pending civil suit and not for the Tahsildar to pass an order directing the parties to maintain status-quo during the pendency of the civil suit. 16. In the instant case, it is pointed out that a decree has been passed declaring the right of the impleading applicant in the family properties and for allotment of her share as back as in the year 1972.It is also pointed out by Sri Angadi, learned counsel appearing for the impleading applicant that till today impleading applicant has not been able to secure the fruits of the decree. Learned counsel for the petitioner points out that appeal filed against the decree is pending before this Court.If that is so, both parties are well advised to expedite the said appeal or request the Court to refer the matter for mediation so that long standing litigation c",

G.Rajaganapathy Advocate, High Court of Madras.",
            "Dear Client, In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during the Domestic Violence (DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case under section 354 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case. For these legal issues, you should consult a family law attorney to assist you on the matter to avoid further complications. Hope you find this answer satisfactory.",

Yes, 3. You can submit the proofs of her beautician work proofs before the court at the time of deciding the maintenance 4. As per Supreme Court judgment, wife is expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter. - Further, the court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of “cruelty” after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws. - Further, If wife is not supporting her husband for the enjoyment of life and denying relation, then the husband can get divorce after filing a divorce petition before the court on this ground. 5.

            "If it’s comes under land acquisition then you will get appropriate compensation as per the Act",
            "In your situation, where a 133KV cable and tower have been plotted on your land for over 15 years, and you haven't been compensated, there are several legal avenues you can explore to seek compensation and remedy the loss of land value. Here’s an analysis based on the facts you provided: 1. Eligibility for Compensation: Land Acquisition Laws: Typically, when government or private entities (like power distribution companies) use land for laying cables, towers, or other infrastructure, they need to either acquire the land or compensate the landowner. If the use of the land was without proper acquisition or compensation, you could potentially seek compensation under relevant laws, such as the Land Acquisition Act or the Electricity Act. Prescription Period: While compensation claims generally need to be filed within a certain time frame (typically 3 to 5 years in many cases), certain exceptions can apply. Since this is a long-standing issue (15 years), it may be difficult to claim compensation under regular statutes unless it can be shown that: If there was no formal acquisition process followed at the time the cable and tower were placed, and you were not compensated for the land used, you might still have the right to seek compensation or initiate legal proceedings. 2. Steps for Seeking Compensation: Review the Agreement or Consent (if any): If there was any agreement (written or verbal) between you and the authorities or company regarding the land usage, it would be essential to review that. This document could provide grounds for a claim. File a Claim for Compensation: If no formal compensation was offered or made, you can file a formal complaint with the Electricity Regulatory Commission or the relevant authority responsible for the installation of the cable and tower (such as the electricity board or municipal corporation). You may also consider seeking compensation for loss of land value or damages. Pursue Legal Action in Court: If the authority refuses to provide compensation, you could file a suit in the appropriate civil court for compensation under the provisions of the Electricity Act (specifically Section 67 of the Act for laying cables) or even under the Land Acquisition Act if it was a case of acquisition without compensation. Public Interest Litigation (if applicable): If the authority is misusing public land or if the matter affects public interest, you might also approach the High Court for a writ petition or Public Interest Litigation (PIL). 3. Land Use and Development Issues: Land Not Being Counted in Colony Development: If the land is being underutilized or considered unavailable for development (for example, for roads or parks) due to the presence of the cable and tower, this might constitute an issue of non-use or restriction placed by the authorities without proper justification. Request for Land Rectification or Relocation: You may want to request the authorities to either: Land Use Permits or Zoning Considerations: You can file a representation with the local municipal corporation or zoning authorities, requesting that the land be formally cleared for development. If the authorities are preventing development due to the cable and tower, there may be room to request a change in zoning or an exemption from certain regulations for the land. 4. Practical Steps to Take: Consult a Property Lawyer: It would be prudent to consult with a property or land acquisition lawyer who can assess the specifics of your case and advise on the best course of action for claiming compensation, removing the restrictions on your land, and preventing further losses. Send a Legal Notice: If the authorities have been unresponsive or are refusing to compensate you for the land use, you can send a legal notice demanding compensation and/or removal of the cable and tower. File a Case for Injunction: If you are unable to prevent the authorities from continuing to block your land development, you can file a case seeking an injunction to prevent them from wasting or misusing the land. Conclusion: You may still be eligible to seek compensation for the use of your land for the cable and tower, despite the long period that has passed, depending on the specific circumstances. Additionally, you can explore options for challenging the continued blockage of your land use for colony development. It is advisable to consult with a qualified lawyer specializing in property law or land acquisition to help you understand your legal rights, options for compensation, and remedies for land use issues.

No local authority, like Darul Qaza, Jamaat, or a registered Kazi, was involved. However, two witnesses from both sides signed the document, but it is not notarised on any bond. Can this Khulanama be challenged in the future, and does it have any legal impact on me? Someone also suggested me to approach local Kazi to get it validated. Please suggest.",
        "answers": [
            "Legally speaking there is no necessity for the Darul Qaza or the Jamaat to certify the Khulanama, because they are not the legal authority to grant divorce under Muslim personal law. The Personal law is very clear that the khulanama or talaq becomes valid with anyone witnessing it. If you still insist on further legal compliance in this regard, you may have to file a civil suit for declaration to declare the dissolution of your marriage by Khulanama is valid. No doubt this divorce decree/judgment would be pertinent if you want to remove your spouse name from your passport and not otherwise. Therefore this Khulanama declaration with two witnesses attesting the same is a legally valid divorce as per Muslim personal law in general law too.",

            "khula requires a formal procedure. It has to be certified by office of local qazaath attested by wakf board. Procedure for valid khula/divorce is laid down by State government. Any khula ignoring such procedure is invalid.",
            "You need to file petition in family court for the validation process of khulanama as per shariat Act",
            "Under Muslim personal law, a Khulānamā (divorce by mutual consent initiated by the wife) can be valid, but there are certain requirements and nuances involved in its legal validity and enforceability. Here’s an analysis based on the details you have provided: 1. Validity of Khulanama Without Darul Qaza, Jamaat, or Kazi Involvement: Role of Darul Qaza, Jamaat, or Kazi: While the involvement of a Darul Qaza, Jamaat, or a Kazi is not mandatory for a Khulā under Muslim law, it is advisable to have a formal and legal process to ensure the document's validity. A Kazi is generally considered an authoritative figure who can officiate and record the Khulā, ensuring both parties understand the terms and conditions. Witnesses: The requirement of two witnesses from both parties is generally enough to validate the Khulā, assuming that both parties agree to the terms voluntarily. However, notarization or registration is not a strict requirement under Muslim law, but it helps strengthen the document's authenticity in the eyes of the law. 2. Legal Impact and Potential for Challenge: Challenging the Khulanama: Since the Khulā was sent by your ex-wife via registered post, the absence of Kazi or registered authority could make it slightly more vulnerable to challenges. However, the presence of witnesses(from both parties) and the clear agreement to the divorce generally make it a valid document under Muslim law. If either party disputes the Khulā or claims that it was forced or coerced, the lack of formal registration or the absence of a Kazi could allow for potential challenges. In such a case, a court could examine the circumstances surrounding the signing of the Khulā, including the involvement of witnesses and the lack of notarization. 3. Legal Consequences for You: Does it affect your legal status? If the Khulā was executed properly, it would be treated as a divorce under Muslim law, and there should be no ongoing marital obligations between you and your ex-wife. However, since the document was not formalized by a Kazi or court, there is a possibility of future legal complications or challenges, particularly if your ex-wife or her family later disputes the Khulā or seeks to reverse the divorce. 4. Can You Approach a Kazi to Validate It? Validation by a Kazi can add legitimacy to the Khulā. You can approach a local Kazi to have the Khulā formally validated and recorded in the presence of the Kazi. This may involve having the document signed again in the presence of the Kazi, who can then provide an official stamp or validation. This would strengthen the legal standing of the Khulā. Judicial recognition of a Khulā might depend on the jurisdiction of the court you approach, but having the Khulā documented in a formal and official manner is beneficial to avoid future challenges. 5. Steps You Can Take: Approach a Kazi or Darul Qaza: To ensure the document’s legal standing, especially if it is being questioned, you can approach a local Kazi or Darul Qaza to have the Khulā formally recorded. While the absence of these bodies doesn’t automatically invalidate the Khulā, getting it officially recorded can help safeguard against future disputes. Consult a Lawyer: You may want to consult a lawyer experienced in family law and Muslim personal law for further advice on securing your rights and ensuring the Khulā is legally valid and enforceable. Conclusion: While your Khulā may be valid under Muslim personal law, the absence of formalization by a Kazi or court makes it susceptible to future challenges, particularly if any party disputes the terms. It is advisable to approach a Kazi or Darul Qaza to have it validated, which can help in providing legal certainty. Consulting a lawyer specializing in family law can also be a good step to ensure your position is legally protected."

My wife had got divorce decree under section on 30th May 2024 (Section 13(1)(ia) - divorce on the ground of cruelty, Section 13(1)(ib) divorce on the ground of desertion ). I am living abroad, so it took me some time to coordinate with my lawyer and appeal in High Court. With some back and fro, summons was issued to her on Oct 28, 2024. But it has come to my knowledge that she married around Nov 21, 2024. Q1. Let’s suppose she does not appear in High Court and High Court ex-parte overturns the decision of family court; how can I then proceed further. Q2. If summons were not delivered to her before her marriage date, in that case will my appeal will be defunct or still there is something I can get. Q3. . If summons were indeed delivered to her before her marriage date, in that case will what are my options ? Can I charge her for bigamy (I don’t have material evidence for her marriage)",
        "answers": [
            "Your wife has remarried after period of 3 months of divorce decree 2) her remarriage is valid no case of bigamy is made out 3) if HC set asides ex parte decree the case would be remanded to family court for trial 4) your appeal is infructous if summons were not delivered to her before her remarriage",
            "- As per law, the limitation period for filing the appeal or setting aside the ex-parte decree of divorce is 90 days from the date of passing of the decree by the Court. - Since, the said decree was granted to her on 30 May , and she re-marry in Nov,24 it means that her marriage is legal - However , you have right to file the appeal against that decree of divorce on the ground of date of knowledge /information and on the ground of non-service of the summons - Further, if the High Court set-aside the decree then the matter will be remand back to trail family court. - No , bigamy case is maintainable as she has married after the expiry period of 90 days.",
            "The period for filing appeal commenced 31.05.2024. Period of limitation is 90 days from the date of order so in your case limitation had expired on 30.08.2024 while summons were issued to her after expiry of period of limitation and further there was no stay order staying the order dated 30.05.24 so there was no restriction against wife from performing her second marriage. Mere issuance of stay does not amount to stay. Generally high court in such cases try to reconciliate the matter as the wife's second marriage cannot be reverted. No case of bigamy is made out against wife even if you succeed in your appeal. In given circumstances second marriage of wife is fully valid.",
            "1. Even though she may decide not appear before high court, the high court will pass an order on the merits on the grounds of appeal because it appears that the trial court judgment was on the basis of contested divorce and not an exparte divorce. . 2. If she appears before court and informs court that she remarried after the expiration of time limit for filing an appeal but before she received the summons, the court may consider her pleadings as well. 3. It cannot be considered as an act of bigamy because the time limit for filing an appeal is 30 days from the date of judgment excluding the time taken for obtaining certified copies, hence she is very well within her rights to remarry after the time limit for appeal, hence it cannot be considered as an act of bigamy especially in the absence of any stay order staying the judgment delivered by the trial court in this regard. The time limit for filing an appeal against a family court judgment in a divorce case before the high court is 30 days from the date of the judgment. Section 19(3) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 states that an appeal against a judgment or order passed by the Family Court must be filed within 30 days. Hence your thoughts of filing a complaint under bigamy is not maintainable.",
            "Q1: If she does not appear in the High Court and the High Court overturns the family court’s decision ex-parte, how can you proceed? If the High Court overturns the family court’s divorce decree ex-parte: Q2: If the summons were not delivered to her before her marriage date, will your appeal be defunct, or is there recourse? Q3: If the summons were delivered before her marriage date, what are your options? Can you charge her for bigamy?

Here’s a breakdown of your situation based on the questions you asked: 1. Grounds for Divorce and Rejection of Petition Given the dynamics you’ve described, your wife could potentially file for divorce on grounds such as cruelty, given her previous DV claims, or on grounds of irretrievable breakdown of marriage if she argues that living together is impossible due to differences and disputes. However, whether her petition would be successful depends on her ability to prove these claims in court. 2. Rights to Stay in Her Flat 3. Custody of Children and Participation in Their Lives 4. Maintenance and Financial Support Legal Steps to Take:",

If the flat is on her name she can demand you to vacate the flat failing which she may file a suit for eviction. 3. You can file child custody case and get orders on the basis of documentary evidences in your support. 4. Divorce case you can challenge and get it dismissed but child custody case you have to strongly contest on merits."

            "Civil and criminal proceedings are separate and can proceed simultaneously",
            "Hello, You can certainly file a civil suit for money recovery in court parallel to the ongoing criminal investigation. Filing a civil case does not require you to close or withdraw the FIR you have filed at the police station. These are two separate legal processes: Criminal Process: The FIR you filed initiates a criminal investigation into the act of fraud or theft (depending on the circumstances of your case). The police are responsible for investigating the criminal aspects, such as the intent to deceive. Civil Process: A civil recovery suit is focused solely on the recovery of the money you lent. This process is about enforcing the repayment of a debt and does not necessarily concern the criminal aspects like the intention behind not repaying the money. Steps to File a Civil Suit for Money Recovery: Document Collection: Gather all evidence of the loan, including bank transfer details, any communication between you and the borrower acknowledging the debt, and the legal notice you sent. Legal Representation: It would be advisable to hire a lawyer who specializes in civil litigation to draft and file the suit. Your lawyer will prepare a statement of claim outlining the details of the transaction and the subsequent breach (non-payment). Filing the Suit: The suit is filed in the appropriate civil court based on the amount of money involved and the jurisdiction over the area where either the defendant resides or the transaction took place. Court Proceedings: The court will issue a summons to the defendant, and the legal process will follow, where both parties will have the opportunity to present their cases. If the court finds in your favor, it will issue a judgment against the defendant, which can include the debt amount, interest, and possibly legal costs. While the civil case is ongoing, continue to follow up with the police regarding the criminal case. The outcomes of these cases can complement each other; for example, a judgment in the civil case might strengthen the criminal case by establishing the fact of the debt and the default.

We have a land of 5716sqfts with two side entrance and a single house of the front entrance. The whole plot was on my father’s Elder uncle name (A) who had no son or daughter and my grandfather (B) and his younger brother (C) use to live with him. After my grand father’s marriage when my father was born the elder brother (A) of my grandfather on whose name was the land he gave my grandfather 1350sqft land from the whole land to make a house behind the existing house verbally without any documentation. Then after the marriage of my grandfather’s younger brother (C), (A) Gave him (C) 810sqft land on the other entrance of the land verbally without any documentation. So the whole plot with two entrances have two houses and our house of my grandfather was in the center of the two houses the whole plot was marked with a common pathway from front to back keeping my grandfather’s (B) house in the center or we can say at the back. Then in 2003 the (A) who had no son gave 2900sqft to his younger brother (C) with a gift deed and my grandfather was unaware of it. Then in 2007 the (A) elder brother of my grandfather died. Then in 2023 we got to know about the gift deed. I am living in my grandfather’s house but the land is still on his elder brother’s name (A). So 2900sqft in on my grandfather’s younger brother’s name. The house i am living in has 1350sqft land and the remaining 1466sqft is the common pathway of 4ft width and length of 361aprox. So back in 2014by a connection of my friends i made a new document of my land as abadi deh land as my grandfather(B)was in the possession of the land 1350sqft from 70 years. I got a proper sale deed on my wife’s name the proper revenue documents. Its been 10years now i have the documents. Also the land documents of these 1350sqft land was originally in the ownership name of my grandfather’s eleder brother’s name (A) but they were never found he never gave it to anyone no one knows where are they. We tried finding then in revenue but were never found. Also my grandfather was never given any land from it as all they have was this land to live on. SO I HAVE 2 QUESTIONS: 1) is my ownership (wife name documents) legal? 2) can i claim the direct pathway excess to the two gates because i have to walk around their two houses to get the excess to the main road.

What are the steps involved? • Validity: How long does the PoA remain valid? Should there be a specific end date or an event triggering its revocation? Execution in Multiple Jurisdictions • If the PoA needs to be executed in different cities or states, does it require additional legalization or notarization?

            "Dear Client, I strongly advise him to be given General Power of Attorney. Under this arrangement, your father can manage all his financial and legal affairs and property in one single document for the purpose of covering financial transactionbank management, investments, taxes, legal matters like signing of contracts and settlement of disputes with properties such as buying selling or leasing. It must be registered in the Sub-Registrar's office in the case of property-related powers; notarization is enough for monetary and legal purposes. In this case, the drafting of the PoA, visiting the Sub-Registrar with identification documents and witnesses, paying the stamp duty, and registration fees are followed. The time or event-bound, or it remains indefinite unless formally revoked by your father. In case it is executed across cities or states, the registered PoA is valid across all states, but with added authenticity through notarization, and stamp duty would vary according to jurisdictions. A well-drafted and registered PoA ensures smooth and legally secure procedure by empowering you to be more effective in assisting your father. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute."

My wife have not allowed me to touch her for last 10 years except for first 2-3 months of marriage. Now we are into martial dispute & have sent a mutual divorce notice for which she has demanded 1.5 Crore to settle the divorce. Practically the amount too high from my reach & now she has filed false DV, rape under section 376 to put pressure on me also she has pulled my parents into her complaint stating bad behaviour , accusing for giving bad words used by my mother to her in spite they do not stayed with me throughout my married life.. I know she is using my son as safe guard to get all this things done. Though we are staying in same flat but as flatmate she has done all the above complaints. I am not sure how to proceed from here as false rase case will ruin me my family completely. I need to finish this mutually but she is not ready. Pls suggest",

Therefore, you can initiate appropriate proceeding to quash this charge.",
            "As such there is no need or requirement to sent notice calling for mutual divorce as mutual divorce happens by mutual agreement of parties and not by notice. IPC is now not in force however no case of rape is made out. Demand of 1.5 is illegal and unjustified. File divorce case and also claim custody of child. Allegations are required to be contested. Consult a competent lawyer and act under his guidance.",
            "Pls under stand that for this to be resolved mutually, her consensus is also needed. You have to strongly contest the false and naslwad cases filed by you. You/your parents should also file counter cases against her. File a divorce petition on the ground if cruelty as you’ve been denied physical relationship. Filing counter cases will balance the pressure; and eventually, sooner or later all of this will get resolved mutually"

One rider sustained a fracture and was admitted to the hospital, while the other rider suffered minor wounds and received treatment in the hospital. An FIR was filed against the rider with minor injuries. The minor-injured rider was crossing the traffic junction when the signal light was green, traveling at a speed of 40 km/h. The other rider, who was injured more severely, came from the right side and took a turn towards the right without noticing the oncoming two-wheeler. Additionally, a van obstructed the view at the junction. When the police were asked for the CCTV footage, they orally stated that it was not available. In the FIR filed by police under section 125A and 281 of BNS 2023 police did not mention the injured rider coming from left of the road and moving towards the road at intersection to the right side. (T Junction) The charge sheet is not yet filed. In this background, is it better for the minor-injured two-wheeler rider to plead guilty, pay the fine, and close the matter, or fight the case in court? What are the repercussions of both actions?

They have gone one step ahead by stating in the deed \" that the 1st Party had duly applied for extension of the Building plan to construct further storey from the competent authority of Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the same was sanctioned and upon obtaining the said plan the said 1st party started construction of the said Multistoried building on the said plot of land,duly completed the said constructions in all respect and duly made it habitable in all respect official purpose\".

Although it's just a week since I lodged a complaint but wanted to know what I have to do ahead to make sure that the competent authorities take appropriate actions against the Buyer and Seller who have both sold and bought the property on a fake plan & by misrepresentations. Do I have to file a writ or a PILin case if any of the above authorities don't take any steps against the people concerned who are very rich, influential & politically connected? Interestingly this additional floor is the one where KMC had filed a FIR for unauthorised construction,had also shown demolition proceedings on the same floor. But the parties have managed to register & mutate the property this way. My appeal has been drafted for the appeal bench as the case was dismissed on stupid grounds that the illegal constructions had come 7 yrs back and is an old issue. The opposition advocates tried to look into the defects of my writ petition where I had not filed Speed Post Delivery Report. Let me be honest it was a biased judgement made by Single Bench Judge.

Section 30(5) of the the Telngana S&E Act reads as below - Every employee in any establishment shall also be entitled during his first twelve months of continuous service and during every subsequent twelve months of service (a) to leave with wages for a period \"not exceeding twelve days on the ground of any sickness or accident and (b) to casual leave with wages for a period not exceeding twelve days\" on any reasonable ground. The above provision says \"NOT EXCEEDING\" 12 days in case of sick and casual leaves. Whereas the other provisions either specify the exact number of leaves or use the term \"NOT LESS THAN\". My question is does this imply and mean that an organization can give less than 12 days of sick and casual leave i.e. 6 days of casual leave and 6 days of sick leave?",
        "answers": [
            "Yes, the wording \"not exceeding twelve days\" in Section 30(5) of the Telangana Shops and Establishments Act suggests that the law sets a maximum limit of twelve days each for sick leave and casual leave. Therefore, an organization can indeed choose to provide fewer than twelve days for each type of leave, such as six days of casual leave and six days of sick leave, as long as the total number of such leaves provided does not exceed the specified twelve days per type annually. This flexibility allows employers to set their own leave policies within the bounds of this maximum limit specified by the Act, meaning they can offer less than twelve days, but not more.

            "Section 30(5) of the Telangana Shops and Establishments Act uses the term \"not exceeding twelve days\" for sick leave and casual leave, which implies that an organisation has the discretion to provide fewer than 12 days of each type of leave. Unlike provisions in the Act that specify exact entitlements or minimum thresholds using terms like \"not less than,\" the phrase \"not exceeding\" sets a maximum limit. This allows employers to decide the allocation of sick and casual leave within the ceiling of 12 days, for example, providing 6 days of sick leave and 6 days of casual leave. However, the total leave granted for sickness or casual reasons cannot exceed the stipulated 12-day limit. Organisations must ensure their leave policies align with this provision unless employment contracts, company policies, or state-level notifications mandate otherwise. To avoid disputes, employers should clearly outline their leave policies in employee handbooks, ensuring compliance with the law while considering employee welfare and market standards.

My parents entered my date of birth in my Birth Certificate as 15.04.2002, even after knowing my real date of birth, i.e., 07.08.2001. I never bothered because I thought this was a normal thing to do. (The reason that I remember for why my father altered my date of birth is this - I was small when he said this, but if I could recall it, it was this: \"The date of birth is altered so that if I failed in 10th Exam, I could give 10th Exam again next year without having an effect on my age, which would help me in getting jobs later on.\") As I grew up, I don't know what happened to me - but for some reason - I cannot lie, or cannot hide anything. So, I felt like to correct my date of birth too in my Birth Certificate - which I never felt before. But I also know this cannot be done maybe as all of my documents have this date of birth, i.e., 15.04.2002. I also asked my father and confirmed that we do not have the Hospital Discharge Certificate (or if we ever had one). My question is, if I cannot change the date of birth in my legal documents because of no proof, can I still talk about it to people, like, \"Hey, in my Birth Certificate this date of birth is given. But my real date of birth is 07.08.2001\"? Will talking about it more get me into some kind of problem?

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has the authority to take action against unauthorized constructions, which can include demolition or penalties. Relying on potential future regularization schemes, such as the Building Regularisation Scheme (BRS), is uncertain and may not materialize. Additionally, obtaining home loans for such properties can be challenging, as financial institutions typically require proper approvals. Investing in a property without the necessary approvals can lead to legal complications and financial losses. It is advisable to purchase properties that have all requisite approvals to ensure a secure investment. For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy.

After marriage she used to create unwanted argument and quarrel for minor issues. In our 2 years of marriage she lived separately for 1yr 2 months. We have no kids. Now my wife accusing me of domestic violence and filed a complaint in PS. They are ready for getting divorce. They have given 5 lakhs (cash) as dowry and now they are demanding 20 lakhs for settlement. Kindly suggest me what to do? 1. Should I file RCR ? My wife needs divorce and after filing RCR will court order me to pay any kind of alimony to her ? Her annual income is 4.5 lakh and mine 7.2 lakh. 2.If court orders for alimony how much will it be ? As she is working and we have no kids. Or 3. Is legal process or outside settlement through mediators is better for this? Because we came to know that it my take 2-3 years by going legal.

            "1. No. RCR is wastage of time and money. No court can comple a person to live with other against his/her wishes so even if you succeed even then court order would remain ineffective. since wife is earning so she may not not be able to claim maintenance. 2. None. However, wife may raise demand for seperate residence so court may order to husband to arrange rented accommodation for wife. 3. Yes, mutual settlement is best but inly court order and decree can dissolve a marriage. Except court there is no other mode or authority to dissolve a marriage.",
            "Dear Client, In your case, with the wife working and bringing in ₹4.5 lakhs per annum and no children, the demand for ₹20 lakhs can be contested as unreasonable. You can file a restitution of conjugal rights petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, but this may not be effective because your wife has already made a declaration to the court for a divorce. Filing RCR may delay the process of divorce, and the court may still order interim maintenance based on both parties' incomes; however, the amount will probably be very minimal considering that she is earning. In case you decide to continue with divorce, amounts of alimony or settlement will depend on factors such as the period of marriage, incomes, and standard of living; since she is earning, the amount may be substantially reduced. A mediated settlement is likely to be faster and less costly than a contested process in the courts, which would take about 2-3 years. Negotiate a mutually acceptable amount of settlement based on her requirements and economic independence to wrap up the matter amicably, avoiding lengthy litigation. Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.",
            "You can go for the mutual consent divorce instead of the RCR and take an order from the court of MCD. You can make the first MoU before MCD, and there is no need to pay her alimony as she is a working woman and sufficient to take care of herself.",
            "1. RCR is not a solution besides it is a waste exercise. If you feel that it would be no more possible to tolerate her behavior or continue this marital relationship, you can go for mutual consent divorce on negotiated terms. 2. She is employed and earning a handsome salary income hence she will not be eligible for maintenance or alimony, you collect her income details by documents and fight it out properly in case she files a petition seeking maintenance. 3. It may take two to three years if the case is conducted by contested divorce, hence you can decide about negotiated settlement if you want to get rid of it quickly."

The consummation of marriage has not happened since the “vidayi” of the bride has itself not happened. The groom went back to US a week later and now wants to divorce the wife because of ill treatment by the wife and her family over calls, wife’s family continuously asking for money, and the marriage intentions getting clear that the girl’s family got her married to the boy because of his American Citizenship status. After many arguments, the boy has sent a voice note to the girl and her family over WhatsApp that he wants to divorce and pronounced “Talaq” just once. What should be next steps? Whom to approach? How to get a Talaqnama? How to send a formal/official letter and finalize the Talaq? (Note that both the families are sunni muslims and the marriage was performed by a Qazi)",

Mention the reasons for divorce. 4) Return your wife’s Maher amount and pay maintenance during iddat period",

            "Merely because man pronounced talaq on phone is not sufficient nor the same amount ti talaq between the parties. Talaq should be in the presence of minimum two competent witnesses and each talaq should be pronounced on each tuhr (mensuration) of the girl.",
            "In this case, the American citizen (groom) has pronounced Talaq through a WhatsApp voice note which while informal may still be recognized under Islamic law if properly followed by formal steps. To finalize the divorce, the groom should send a written notice of Talaq to the wife through registered post stating his intent to divorce and the reasons behind it. This notice should be sent after ensuring that the wife observes the iddat period (waiting period) as per Islamic law. The groom can then approach a Qazi to request the issuance of a Talaqnama after the iddat period has passed. If the wife contests the divorce legal action may be needed in the family court in India, where issues like maintenance or alimony can be addressed. For a smooth process, it is recommended that the groom should seek legal advice from a family lawyer in India to ensure compliance with both Islamic and Indian law applicable in the matter.",
            "It appears that you have pronounced divorce by Talaq ahsan. Talaq Ahsan is a type of divorce in Muslim law that is considered the most proper and acceptable. In Talaq Ahsan, a husband divorces his wife by making a single pronouncement of divorce during the period of Tahr, when the wife is not menstruating. The husband must also not have had sexual intercourse with her during this time. Another type of legally valid talaq is by pronouncing Talaq Hasan. The husband divorces his wife by making three pronouncements of divorce during the wife's menstrual cycles. However both are legally valid. But in case you have got your marriage subsequently registered under special marriage act then you may have to file a suit for declaration to declare the dissolution of your marriage by talaq as valid before a civil court in India for proper adjudication."

        "full_text": "How to ensure wife does not backtrack after first motion. Hello esteemed advocates. Recently my wife has agreed for a mutual divorce. My questions are: 1. On the first motion, I am returning the gifts they had given us (car, jewellery etc.). Should I also pay some part of the cash agreed upon? Or should I withhold it for second motion and later on for divorce decree? 2. How do I ensure that my wife does not backtrack after the first motion? 3. They had filed many cases against me and my family. When are they supposed to withdraw all of them? Before the first motion or some time later? Thank you.",
        "answers": [
            "1. You may have to intelligently play your role now stating that you will handover all the items during first motion, but you hold back the jewels on the first motion and return the car alone. During second motion, if she withdraws all other cases then you return the jewels and handover DD for the agreed amount. If there are still some cases pending you may just give her a photocopy of the DD and handover original later on when everything is finalized. 2. If she is backtracking from mutual consent divorce then you can file a contested divorce by converting this case. 3. If she has agreed to withdraw all the cases then you can put pressure on her to take steps to withdraw everything before second motion, if it is not possible then you can take an adjournment of the second motion to accommodate her steps to withdraw all the cases by then.",

            "In a mutual consent divorce, everything should be clearly written in an agreement and submitted to the court. You can return gifts (like a car or jewelry) during the first motion and pay part of the agreed cash amount at this stage, but keep the remaining payment for the second motion and final divorce decree to ensure both sides follow through. The agreement should also include a condition that your wife and her family withdraw all cases they have filed against you before or at the time of the first motion and proof of withdrawal should be provided to the court. To avoid your wife backing out after the first motion, include a clause in the agreement that both of you are legally bound to proceed to the second motion. Engage a lawyer to ensure the agreement is clear, fair, and enforceable under the law."

Case Status (June 2024): The Section 125 CrPC revision petition is pending before the High Court. 3.

Below are my questions: 1)Ownership and Title Verification: How can I verify the complete ownership history of the property, especially if records do not explain how the current landowner acquired it before 2005(pahani records from 2005)?Can the absence of earlier ownership details (e.g., inheritance, purchase, or government allotment) pose risks to my ownership in the future? 2)GPA and Developer Agreement: Is it safe to buy property where the developer, acting under a GPA, executes the sale deed without the landowner directly participating? What risks arise if the GPA is revoked, contested by the landowner or their heirs, or deemed invalid? How can I mitigate these risks? Should the sale deed explicitly reference the GPA details and include an indemnity clause to protect me from future claims? What key clauses should I verify in the Development Agreement between the landowner and developer to ensure the transaction is legally sound? 3)Approvals and Land Use: Does HMDA approval ensure that the layout and property are legally compliant? Are there specific conditions in the approval I should verify? How can I confirm whether this project is registered under RERA? Is RERA registration mandatory for such developments? What should I check in the land conversion approval (agricultural to residential use) to ensure there are no pending conditions or risks? 4)Registration and Finalization: Should I insist on the landowner co-signing the sale deed along with the GPA holder (developer) for added security? What steps can I take to ensure the sale deed and registration process are legally binding and protect me from third-party claims? 5)General Risks: How can I verify that the property is not classified as Waqf land, Full Tank Level (FTL),Hydraa or government-assigned land, or forest land? Are there risks of undisclosed encumbrances or claims from earlier owners or legal heirs, and how can I protect myself? 6)Is title insurance or any other insurance recommended in this case, and what specific risks should it cover? 7)Final Advice:Based on the above, would you recommend proceeding with this purchase? What are the key precautions I should take to ensure the title is clear and ownership is secure? Additional Context: The land conversion is approved for residential use. The HMDA layout has been sanctioned. The sale deed will likely be executed by the developer under the GPA. There are no records explaining how the landowner acquired the property before 2005. Please advise on the legal risks and steps I should take to safeguard my investment. Thanks in advance Best regards",

            "you need original chain of documents . ask builder to explain absence of earlier documents 2) the sale deed of 2005 must be containing recitals of earlier transactions 3) I presume GPA is registered . land owner cannot revoke GPA if it is coupled with consideration 4)ask developer to indemnify you in case third party claims are made 5) check whether project is registered with RERA . it has RERA registration number 6) land owner signature is not necessary on sale deed 7) contact a local lawyer . ask him to certify whether developer has clear and marketable title to land",

            "Dear Client, Ensure indemnity from the landowner, as absence of records prior to 2005 will increase future claims. Engage a property lawyer and conduct the due diligence process. Obtain documents such as pahani records, title deeds, mutation records, and encumbrance certificates that reflect the complete ownership history. Verify that the GPA is real and that it is also registered, irrevocable, and specific to sale; include GPA details and indemnity clause in the sale deed; ensure HMDA and RERA compliance with duly accorded land conversion approvals with no outstanding encumbrances such as Waqf lands, FTL, or government classifications; demand co-signing of the sale deed by the landowner for additional security; verify the development agreement between the landowner and developer. Consider title insurance to cover such risks as undisclosed claims or ownership disputes. Proceed only if all records are clear, approvals valid, and the title is secure. Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.",

The Principal has to sign. 3. RERA registration is mandatory. 4. Principal has to sign. 5. The revenue records will show the classification of land. GPA based sale deed is risky.

And, I always believed that he would definitely talk about us when his parents brought thr topic of his marriage. His parents started seeing girls for him, but he never opened up about us. I told him many times to open up about us, but he never did. We were together till August first week, and, he went and got engaged to someone in third week of August. I again insisted him to stop the marriage, but he started to emotionally blackmail me, by self hurting and so. In the same time, I got an opportunity to move abroad and I moved from India thinking that change of place will help me overcome this. But actually, it made me realise how much I loved him more.

That may amount to trespass and by law you would have each right to claim removal of something like that after serving notice demanding such removal. If they refuse, you can sue them civilly to get an injunction compelling them not to do any unauthorized alteration or incursion on your property. Again, the same goes for planting trees, and the same is allowed unless and until no nuisance emerges from it. If the trees border the boundary wall, their roots or branches may go into your property damaging the wall or obstruct sunlight or falling debris; in which case, such may constitute a nuisance under property law. You can then ask your neighbor to cut down or remove the trees. You may even draft a letter to the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation or even file a civil suit, in case they are not agreeing to your demands.

Despite both of them wanting this property to be mine in the future, there seems to be major issue with my fathers memory. and father cant recognize or understand anything which is already happening to him? How shall i go about it? What will happen if my mother or father passes away or both. Will there be an issue while transferring the property to my name?

Below are the key details of the situation: 1. Loan Details: Total loaned amount: ₹6,45,000. Of this, ₹4,95,500 was transferred to Mr. Abdul Mohsin’s account as per Mr. Iqbal’s instructions, citing that his own account had active EMI deductions. Abdul Mohsin later handed over the cash to Mr. Iqbal as Abdul Mohsin was working in Iqbal place but there is proof I have. Additionally, ₹1,49,500 was handed over directly in cash to Mr. Iqbal. 2. Repayment Details: Mr. Iqbal repaid ₹1,97,000 in partial amounts from his own account to my account and one amount from his wife account to my account. Balance unpaid: ₹4,48,000. 3. Cheque Bounce: Mr. Iqbal issued two post-dated cheques: ₹2,48,000 (bounced 3 times for \"Insufficient Funds\"). ₹2,00,000 (expiry due in 2 months and no funds). Both cheques were taken back by Mr. Iqbal and replaced with two new cheques: Cheque No. 12345 for ₹2,48,000. Cheque No. 6789 for ₹2,00,000. Both new cheques were dishonored due to insufficient funds. 4. Evidence Available: Bank statements of transactions to Abdul Mohsin’s account. Legal affidavit with Abdul Mohsin confirming the arrangement. Copies of dishonored cheques and return memos. WhatsApp messages and potential audio recordings of Mr. Iqbal acknowledging the debt and promising repayment. Questions for Clarification: 1. How should I present the transaction details in court? Should I emphasize that: The money was transferred to Abdul Mohsin’s account (based on Mr. Iqbal’s instructions) and later handed over to him? Or state that the total amount was lent as a combination of cash and cheques directly to Mr. Iqbal? 2. What is the best approach to strengthen my case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, considering the evidence I have? 3. Can I include compensation for mental harassment and inconvenience caused due to his repeated defaults and dishonored cheques? 4.

The original tenant passed away in March 2019, and presently, in 2024, the tenant’s grandson occupied the property with force, and without any legal authority. Under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (WBPTA), tenancy rights can only be inherited by specific heirs who reside with the tenant at the time of their death, and here, the grandchildren are excluded unless proven to be dependent at the time of death.

In the event that they do not show up after being called by the magistrate, you can ask the magistrate of get a warrant of arrest under Section 72 of BNSS (previously, Section 70 of CrPC). If an accused refuses to respond to or ignore the summons issued to them, you can apply for a bailable warrant under Section 90 of BNSS (previously, Section 87 of CrPC). If the accused fails to follow the direction of the court, the court may order for the arrest of the accused under Section 91 of BNSS (previously, Section 88 of the Criminal Procedure Code) or it may order for a non-bailable warrant. In case the magistrate fails to take proper action you can go to sessions court under Section 438 of BNSS (previously, Section 397 of CrPC) and ask for revision so as to ensure that the summons are enforced to compel the accused to appear. It is necessary to take records of all the hearings and stay in touch with your attorney to manage this process and achieve the goal of punishment for the accused.

Before their engagement, he was already in a relationship with his girlfriend, but kept this hidden. Just 10-20 days before the wedding date, he finally confessed to my sister about his girlfriend and his infidelity. He promised my sister he would be a good husband and care for her without any issues after marriage. Fearing she wouldn't find another marriage prospect and concerned about family prestige, my sister proceeded with the wedding without any recorded proof of this conversation. Within the first month of marriage (March 2023), he was caught red-handed meeting his girlfriend in a hotel. His parents and he desperately begged my sister not to inform our family, promising this wouldn't happen again. In her state of shock, my sister didn't document this incident and didn't tell us until months later, which is why we didn't intervene at that time. One evening between 8-10 PM, his parents verbally abused my sister in front of other family members, making baseless accusations about her character. Hurt by these allegations, she left their house around midnight (12:00-12:30 AM), informing her husband while leaving. When my mother and I later took her back to her in-laws' home and confronted them about the affair and abuse, his mother demanded proof of the affair and denied the abuse. Instead, they criticized my sister for leaving home late at night without telling anyone. Despite this confrontation, my mother encouraged them to reconcile. Later, during my sister's visit to our home, her husband blocked her on WhatsApp without explanation and wouldn't answer calls. When my mother contacted his parents and elder brother about this, they dismissed it as a minor issue. After a family meeting with elders, my sister returned to her in-laws' home. In September 2023, her father-in-law inappropriately questioned my sister about her physical relationship with her husband, which led to her confronting him angrily. This November, when my sister wanted to visit our home for some work, she tried calling her husband, but his phone was switched off. After an argument with her father-in-law about this, she left their home. Her husband continues to ignore her calls. They live in Bengaluru while we're in Andhra Pradesh. My sister also works in Bengaluru in hybrid work mode. We want to arrange a family discussion to either work toward reconciliation or proceed with divorce, but they seem to not care about coming to our town or my sister leaving their home.

            "Dear Client, In Kerala, the land use regulations are governed by the Kerala Town and Country Planning Act, 2016, and the Kerala Municipality Act, 1994. These laws require certain permissions for converting residential plots to commercial use. If the driving school is operating on a residential plot without conversion to commercial use, it might be in violation of these regulations. Under the Kerala Municipality Act, the Corporation or Municipality is responsible for regulating land use and ensuring compliance with zoning laws. If the plot has not been converted for commercial purposes, operating a driving school there without permission could be illegal. You can pursue a civil suit for nuisance and seek relief for damages and an injunction to prevent further disturbances. Request the court to issue a mandatory injunction to prevent the driving school from operating until proper permissions are obtained and the nuisance is addressed. Petition the Municipal Corporation to take immediate safety measures such as installing a boundary wall or barriers to prevent accidents and protect your property. Engage with local authorities to ensure compliance with safety and land use regulations. For Criminal recourse, you can request the police to register an FIR Considering that the preliminary investigation confirms that the allegations are true. you can file a complaint with the Superintendent of Police or approach the Magistrate to direct the police to register the FIR.",
            "In India, it's illegal to use residential property for commercial purposes without permission from the local authority. The zoning law divides properties into zones, and some activities are prohibited in residential areas. For example, selling liquor, machines, timber, and automobile products are not permitted in some residential areas The driving school is also a commercial activity and being run by the owner without proper licence or permission from the local civic authority. You can give a complaint to the corporation authorities about it an also can mention that such illegal activities are causing great nuisance and hardship to all the neighbors of the locality, residential land cannot be used for commercial purposes without obtaining the necessary permissions and approvals from the local authorities.",
            "you can file a complaint before corporation. If the police and corporation not taking any action you need to writ petition before the high court.",
            "If civil case is pending in court seek injunction restraining running of driving school during hearing and pendency of suit 2) file RTI application with police station as to what action has been taken on your complaint",
            "Unless any crime is committed not FIR can be registered. Check your local authority rules and regulations. If permission is required from Corporation then do lodge complaint with the Municipality. Another option is to lodge complaint with Motor Vehicle Department to intervene or revoke his license."

        "full_text": "Karnataka Land Reforms Act 1961 under Section 55. Dear Sir. This is Narayan.. Query is about issues related to Karnataka Land Reforms ownership act in 1961 under section 55. I am planning to buy a property in Bengaluru, the land was owed by the former owner received through government notification from Thahasildar in the year 1979. Later the land was sold in the year 1992 (the land was hold up-to 13 years 1 month). Now the property has been converted and layout has been formed in the same.. Developer provided Form 10 and it says - \"Provided also that the land of which the occupancy has been granted to any person shall not within SIX years from the date of the certificate under Section 55 is issued\". The question here is , will that Karnataka Land Reforms act 1961 affect me in the future, if I buy a plot in the mentioned property and will I face any legal issues in further period... (because 1961 act says lock-in period is 15 years, but Form 10 clearly says 6 years will be the lock-in period). With all the above situation, Can i purchase a plot or not? Pls suggest, your suggestion/guidance will means a lot. Regards Narayan",
        "answers": [
            "Seek necessary clarification from developers 2) obtain written opinion from local lawyer that title is clear and marketable and then only purchase the plot 3) if conversion has been granted and layout approved you can purchase plot",
            "1. When the lock-in period of 15 years is mentioned in the order issued by the Tahsildar, under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act 1961, under section 55, the sale deed in 1992 becomes null & void. 2. Please get the property papers vetted by any Lawyer before proceeding further.",
            "The granted land has been alienated within the restricted period by the allottee, this is clear violation of the conditions. The builder who made the layout will not be available to face the legal issues after selling the flats. Have you obtained legal opinion from an experienced local lawyer to scrutinize the property related documents and whether any recommendation was made to buy the property? If not, first consult a local lawyer and get his opinion and proceed only when recommended.",
            "Dear Client, In the Present Scenario, the land you are considering for purchase in Bengaluru was owned by the former owner, that was received through government notification from Thahasildar in the year 1979. Later, the land was sold in the year 1992, and presently, the property has been converted and layout for the same is formed. To avoid future legal issues, it is suggested that, you verify the grant conditions given under Form 10, and confirm that the 1992 sale had the requisite permissions, and thus, ensure that, he land’s conversion and layout formation were duly approved by competent authorities. However, it is also important that you obtain the title verification, the encumbrance certificate, and review the entire chain of ownership with a property lawyer specialising in Karnataka land laws. Herein, if all the processes are lawful and compliant, you may proceed with the purchase. But, if there exists any violations thereby, the transfer may have challenges involved. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",
            "Legal Compliance: The land sale in 1992 happened after the lock-in period (13 years), so it complies with both 6-year and 15-year rules under Section 55. Key Checks Before Purchase: Developer Documents: Ensure proper land conversion, layout approval, and Form 10 compliance. Conclusion: Likely safe to purchase, but consult a property lawyer for due diligence to avoid risks."

She does not want my mother to live with me. My father is no more and my mother stays with me. My wife stayed with me for a maximum 4 days in 2024 that too 1 day at a time. She kept on lying and blaming us for everything. So, we asked her to call her family with some elders so we can discuss and settle the issues. But she doesn't want to bring them. She got transferred to my city and is living somewhere with out even informing us. We got to know it through some other people that she is in same city as mine. I asked her to come, she says she will bring her family and elders and will come. But now she doesn't want to come. We called her mother to send my wife to my house, but her mother is threating with false cases. I am fed up of her lies and blames. My mental wellness has degraded and i am suffering from anxiety from past 3-4 months with multiple hospital checkups. We are thinking of divorce. I am earning around 1.4 lac per month and i pay 45000 emi everymonth for my house which i bought before marriage. My mother is also dependent on me and i spend around 10k for her medicines everymonth. My wife earns around 40k per month. She didn't take a single rupee from me till now as she is living seperately from starting. She did not contribute anything financially to me as well. If we divorce, how much should i pay alimony to her, since it is only been 13 months of marriage.",
        "answers": [
            "Wife refusing g to stay with husband amounts to mental cruelty and is ground for divorce 2) since wife is highly qualified and working she will not get much alimony as you have been married for only a year or so 3) alimony is at discretion of court and depends upon your income ,wife income ,standard of living etc",
            "1. Since the duration of marriage is very less, you may have to shell out little alimony amount only. 2. To determine alimony, so many factors will be taken into account, such as duration of marriage, educational qualifications, employment, age, earning power, etc ,3. May be the alimony amount may be upto twenty five percent of your earnings or less. 4. In case the couple opts for Mutual Consent Divorce, which saves time and money, as also the alimony amount can also be decided amicably.",
            "As far as the alimony is concerned she has to file an application seeking it without which it is not automatic. You can file the divorce case on the grounds of mental cruelty, especially if she has voluntarily abandoned the matrimonial home and living separately on her own and also instructing you to leave your mother behind and stay with her alone, are all considered to be acts of cruelty besides other reasons. If she files an application for alimony she has to file an affidavit declaring her assets and liabilities, if she suppresses her employment and salary income details, you can repudiate her claim mentioning that she has perjured law hence doesn't deserves alimony. That is a matter of trial, hence you can concentrate on the main subject for now.",
            "Dear Client, In the Present Scenario, subsequent to the divorce, alimony would be determined based on various factors, including the duration of the marriage, financial capacity of both spouses, and the wife’s ability to support herself, and so on. Under the BNSS, maintenance is typically granted if the wife is unable to maintain herself, but since your wife is earning Rs. 40,000 per month and has been living separately, her claim for alimony may be reduced. Further, under Hindu Marriage Act, the provisions allow for interim maintenance during divorce proceedings, and permanent alimony based on the husband’s income and the wife’s financial capacity. Here, your monthly income is Rs. 1.4 lakhs, and since your wife is employed, the court will consider your financial obligations you have, as well as her ability to support herself. Further, since your marriage lasted only about 13 months and your wife has not contributed financially to you or the marriage, the court may award an alimony of certain percentage of your monthly income. Additionally, the issues you have, your medical check-ups and so on, would also strengthen your case for divorce. However, it is suggested that you maintain the documentation and salary details of both you and your spouse, so as to maintain a proof for your defence. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",
            "- As per Supreme Court judgment, wife is expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter. - Further, the court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of “cruelty” after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws. - Hence, as per law, she cannot deny living with you, under the condition of separate living from your mother. - Further, If wife is not supporting her husband for the enjoyment of life and denying relation, then the husband can get divorce after filing a divorce petition before the court on this ground. Further, As per Delhi High Court, physical intimacy is an essential aspect of marriage and a wife's continuous refusal to have such relationship with her husband can be a ground for divorce, - Hence, if she is not interested to live with you, then try to take her consent for mutual divorce. - If, she not agrees for mutual divorce, then file a divorce petition on the above mentioned grounds. - Since, she has left you, then for your safeguards, you can lodged a complaint before the police and higher official, as an information, after mentioning the details and also for threatening to implicate you in false dowry cases. - Since, she is earning then she cannot claim maintenance from you."

He said he will go to his lawyer , get the cancellation. Deed drafted and call Me to Pune when the deed is ready . He keeps postponing and lying about this and I have another buyer who is waiting to buy the property. What course of action do I have ? 1.

While this breach makes the purchaser liable, the agreement remains valid until formally cancelled or declared void. Furthermore, according to the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, an Agreement to Sale does not transfer ownership but creates a contractual obligation, meaning selling the property to another buyer without cancelling the first agreement could expose you to a legal action. However, to proceed further with this, you may send a legal notice to the first buyer citing the breach, and demanding cancellation of the agreement. However, if he continues to delay, you can take the initiative to draft a cancellation deed, clearly stating whether you intend to refund or forfeit the advance payment of ₹1. In case of non-compliance or not co-operating to any of your actions, you may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act, 1963, seeking a declaration that the agreement is void due to non-performance.

It pains me to see how humanity and fairness seem to be lost when dealing with NRIs. Please understand that being an NRI does not mean we are devoid of families, emotions, or struggles. Unfortunately, some lawyers seem to treat NRIs as mere opportunities to exploit for financial gain. I am an Australian citizen, and my ex-wife, who was an Australian permanent resident even before our marriage, has been exploiting legal loopholes against me. We separated in February 2016 and obtained a mutual divorce in Australia in August 2018. I have been consistently paying child support since then. However, in December 2018 3 months after divorce, she filed a false Section 498A case against me and my family in India, with the apparent intention of extorting money. She continues to reside and work in Australia. Due to the Look-Out Circular (LOC) issued against me, I have not been able to travel to India since 2018. My attempts to resolve this legally have been extremely frustrating: First Lawyer: In March 2022, I paid ₹120,000 to a lawyer who filed a criminal petition in the Telangana High Court. After the court ordered notice to the other party, the lawyer stopped responding, used abusive language when I followed up, and eventually blocked my number. Second Lawyer: After obtaining an NOC, I appointed another lawyer who suggested bribing the judge with ₹15 lakhs, which I refused. Third Lawyer: In September 2024, I paid ₹50,000 to another lawyer who assured me the case would be listed and quashed quickly. However, after filing the vakalat, he started giving evasive and implausible reasons, such as judges not hearing older cases, and has shown no intent to address my case effectively. I am in urgent need of a resolution. My elderly parents in India require my presence, and I can no longer delay visiting them. I seek clarity on whether it is possible to get my case quashed in the Supreme Court of India based on the recognition of my Australian divorce decree. I am willing to pay for genuine and effective legal services. If there is any lawyer or firm that can help me get my case quashed within a reasonable time frame (ideally within three months), I would greatly appreciate the assistance.

I am making EMI payment every month This account is not NPA still the bank has deposited security cheque taken during Disbursement and deposited it without any intimation. I have even replied to the legal notice which I received. I believe this is mockery of the 138 act. The security with the bank is my house. the entire loan amount cheque which was deposited is illegal as loan account is active and I am making EMI payment every month. I am planning to challenge it in the HC however need all the advice regarding this matter.",

            "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. This practice is being adopted as a matter for recovering the outstanding in case of eventuality. From the lender side they are more concerned about the recovery of the money with the contracted interest amount. Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that if in a transaction, a loan is advanced and the borrower agrees to repay the amount in a specified timeframe and issues a cheque as security to secure such repayment; if the loan amount is not repaid in any other form before the due date or if there is no other understanding or agreement between the parties to defer the payment of amount, the cheque which is issued as security would mature for presentation and the drawee of the cheque would be entitled to present the same. On such presentation, if the same is dishonoured, the consequences contemplated under Section 138 and the other provisions of N.I. Act would flow. When a cheque is issued even though as ‘security’ the consequence flowing therefrom is also known to the drawer of the cheque and in the circumstance stated above if the cheque is presented and dishonoured, the holder of the cheque/drawee would have the option of initiating the civil proceedings for recovery or the criminal proceedings for punishment in the fact situation, but in any event, it is not for the drawer of the cheque to dictate terms with regard to the nature of litigation. However, there are always defences available as per facts and circumstances of each case. Since you have already received the summons, therefore, the case has to appropriately defended. Detailed discussion is required with complete documents. You may contact my secretary to connect with for clarification.",
            "File petition in HC for quashing of 138 case filed against you as there is debt due and payable you have been regular in paying EMI and entire amount is not due and payable 3) complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) cannot be quashed when there are disputed questions of fact",
            "The act on part of bank is legal and is in consonance of law. Bank never accept cheque as security. So when you failed in making payment bank had deposited cheque to recover pending EMI. In loan agreement also bank keep clause for recovery of entire loan amount at once. Nothing wrong on part of bank. No purpose would be served in approaching high court.",
            "Your principles al defence that blank cheque was given as security that amount mentioned in cheque was not due and payable as only 2 EMI were outstanding 3) when a blank cheque is issued you authorise the bank to fill in details and present the cheque for payment 4) the fact that bank can sell the property does not prevent bank from filing case on basis of dishonoured cheque",
            "There is no legal infirmity in using the security cheque for recovering the defaulted loan amount. The bank issued a statutory legal demand notice before filing the cheque bounce case, whereas you failed to avail the opportunity. Therefore the bank has exercised its right to recover the loan amount especially when you continuously defaulted the EMI for two months. The bank cannot make it NPA for two months default. hence for putting pressure on you they have adopted this method. The high court may not entertain any petition for quash. hence you may better contact bank itself and negotiate settlement amount."

You cancel the sale agreement by issuing a legal notice and demand the buyer to execute a cancellation deed jointly.",
            "Dear Client, In the Present Scenario, you may consider the Indian Contract Act, 1872, under which, the failure of the purchaser to pay the full amount within one month, as agreed in the registered Agreement to Sale, constitutes a breach of contract. While this breach makes the purchaser liable, the agreement remains valid until formally cancelled or declared void. Furthermore, according to the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, an Agreement to Sale does not transfer ownership but creates a contractual obligation, meaning selling the property to another buyer without cancelling the first agreement could expose you to a legal action. However, to proceed further with this, you may send a legal notice to the first buyer citing the breach, and demanding cancellation of the agreement. However, if he continues to delay, you can take the initiative to draft a cancellation deed, clearly stating whether you intend to refund or forfeit the advance payment of ₹1. In case of non-compliance or not co-operating to any of your actions, you may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act, 1963, seeking a declaration that the agreement is void due to non-performance. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",

When Bank Deposited these \"Entire amount\" Cheques only Two EMI were outstanding then How come Bank Deposit the cheque of the entire loan amount which was outstanding, the Loan was never NPA and I am still making EMI Payment till date I think for any secure Loan using 138 itself is gross misuse of this act as the purpose of this act as I understand is to prevent Frauds and Cheating and borrower has no other means to recover the dues I might convert this into a PIL and will appreciate considered opinions",

        "full_text": "File Closure Notification letter received from RPO Chandigarh. Dear Sir, My name is Kamal. This is regarding my daughter Hemal Kumari's passport renewal application. Application Details: • Applicant Name: Hemal Kumari • Application Number: CH[deleted] • Date of Birth: [deleted] • PSK: Chandigarh • Application Type: Passport Renewal My daughter submitted all documents at PSK Chandigarh and received acknowledgement from passport office Chandigarh stating documents are accepted subject to police verification clearance. No documents are pending. On next day, we received e-mail stating police verification has been initiated. However, on very next day, we received a file closer notification letter for insufficient documents and asking to meet in person at RPO Chandigarh. The discrepancy in question is that my name appears as \"Kamal Ram\" on her 10th-grade mark sheet, whereas both my Aadhaar card and her passport application list my name as \"Kamal.\" According to me the required documents that establish identity and relationship, including Aadhaar card and birth certificate, have already been submitted. Class 10th certificate is only required for ECNR. My eldest daughter (Misha Kumari) with same documents has been recently granted passport. Now, when all documents are accepted and police verification is initiated, RPO is sending file closer notifications letter. Which is little confusing and frustrating for parents. Can you please advice what shall we do in such case. Can passport office deny or delay my daughters application. Chanding fathers name on class 10th or 12th mark sheet form CBSE is very difficult and long process. Thanks. Kamal",

            "To address the passport file closure: Visit RPO Chandigarh: Bring all relevant documents, including Aadhaar, birth certificate, and your older daughter’s approved passport as supporting evidence. Explain the Name Discrepancy: Clarify that the name difference is minor and does not affect identity verification since the Class 10 certificate is only for ECNR purposes. Request Alternative Solution: Ask if a notarized affidavit confirming your name can be accepted instead of an updated mark sheet. Escalate if Needed: If unresolved, escalate through the RPO grievance cell or Ministry of External Affairs’ portal. This should help resolve the issue without a lengthy correction.",

            "Dear Client, In your case regarding Hemal Kumari's passport renewal application, it is essential to address the discrepancy concerning your name on her Class 10 mark sheet. The passport office has the authority to request additional documentation to verify identity and relationship, especially if there are inconsistencies in the submitted documents. Under the Passport Act, 1967, the authorities can seek clarification regarding documents submitted for passport applications. The requirement for consistent documentation is crucial for establishing identity and relationship. You should attend the meeting at the Regional Passport Office (RPO) in Chandigarh with all relevant documents, including your Aadhaar card and Hemal's birth certificate, to clarify the discrepancy. Explain that your eldest daughter was granted a passport with similar documentation. While the passport office can delay or deny the application based on insufficient documentation, presenting a clear explanation and supporting documents may resolve the issue. If necessary, consider applying for a correction in the Class 10 mark sheet through CBSE, although this process can be lengthy. Hope this answers your query."

        "full_text": "Can common passage be redeveloped with the consent of all joint owners?. In a Family partition deed, the entire plot of land excluding common passage were divided equally among 2 families wherein parties A, B & C are one family (1 father and 2 sons) and parties D & E are another family (1 father and son). There is a common passage (private) to be shared by all parties A, B, C, D & E wherein the value of common passage is mentioned seperately under respective schedules of all the above parties along with their respective share of plots. Value of Common passage specifically mentioned in partition deed for A is Rs.5000, B is Rs.5000, C is Rs.5000, D is Rs.7500 & E is Rs.7500, Totally valued at Rs.30000. Subsequently, Parties A & D (both the fathers of each family) having adjacent plots next to each other had ventured into a joint development with a builder to construct apartments having seperate main entrances on the other side of the road and had blocked their access to common passage with a compound wall which has been in existence for more than 30 years. Now the remaining parties B, C & E (being the sons of each family) are the only users to the common passage for more than 30 years. The following questions now arises. 1. Can the remaining parties B, C & E along with their respective share of plots venture into a Joint development agreement with a builder to utilise the common passage area of more than a ground as part of construction of apartments? 2. If yes, what will be their respective share of value in common passage? and what happens to the value of share in common passage held by parties A & D which has been already redeveloped into apartments? 3. What happens when Party C doesn't give his consent for redevelopment? Can the other parties buyout his proportionate share in common passage thereby relinquishing his rights and proceed with redevelopment among the remaining parties? Note: Party C also has their own entrance other than common passage. 4. Kindly please help with the methods to arrive at the proportionate share value for the above question to execute buyout from Party C. Overall intention for the remaining users of the common passage is to maximize the area of common passage into the redevelopment process to achieve more built-up area. Is there any legal setbacks and hindrances to be aware of? I will be much obliged if I can get all your expert opinions on the above matter at hand. Thanks in advance.",

You must also prepare for the eventual raising of conflict due to one party feeling aggrieved by decisions taken without their consent. Hope this answers your query.",

Since the redevelopment process is for the entire area owned by all the three owners which include the one ground common passage also, on the basis of mutually agreed conditions a registered redevelopment agreement would be the option. 2. The terms of the mutual agreement among all the three owners will be the guidelines in this regard. 3. If one of the owners don't consent for joint redevelopment, then his share of property will be excluded. However if C consents to relinquish his rights over the common passage in return of payment of consideration, it has to be reduced to writing and executed by a registered deed to avoid future legal hassle. 4. No concrete suggestions can be rendered when the issue is based on mutually agreed conditions alone because it cannot be done by legal source.",
            "Joint Development Agreement: Yes, parties B, C, and E can venture into a joint development agreement with a builder to utilize the common passage, provided all parties consent. Share Value in Common Passage: The respective share value in the common passage for B, C, and E would be as per the proportion mentioned in the partition deed (Rs. 5000 for B, Rs. 5000 for C, and Rs. 7500 for E). The shares of A and D, who no longer use or have interest in the passage, would need to be addressed legally (e.g., relinquishment, compensation) to avoid future disputes. Non-Consent of Party C: If C does not give consent, the remaining parties may attempt to buy out C's share. This would require a mutually agreed-upon value or legal valuation to compensate C and obtain their relinquishment of rights. Valuation Method for Buyout: The proportionate share value can be determined based on the current market value of the land or by evaluating the value it contributes to the redevelopment project.

With respect to what documents may be used as proof, you may use the old electricity bills, FDA or other public records, relevant tax records, court orders or the rent agreement.

            "This may come under adverse possession too. The piece of paper written four decades ago can be a good evidence to defend your interests. If the plots were purchased by registered documents then you can even file a suit for declaration for the other plot based on the evidences for your possession and enjoyment",
            "Un registered agreement is in admissible in evidence no registered gift deed or relinquishment deed has been executed they can claim share in property",
            "Dear Client, In the Present Scenario, your grandfather and his brother had jointly owned a plot of land, with an unregistered agreement, in the year 1982. Your grandfather's brother had subsequently relinquished his rights to one plot, that was occupied by your father and his brother. However, here, the Jamabandi still states your grandfather’s brother’s sons, who are presently claiming ownership on the land. Now, despite the agreement, since the same was not registered, their names are legally recognized unless the same is removed legally from the authorised documents. Further, your family may claim for adverse possession on the land, if they had continuously occupied the land for more than 12 years according to the Indian Law. But, to remove their names legally, you may approach the Revenue Department or even file a suit in the court. However, you may establish your ownership over the land, and update the land records if you had a continuous possession since 1982. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",
            "Dear Sir, You are suggested to rely on the principle of adverse posession.",
            "1. Any property sold which values more than Rs.100/- has to be compulsorily registered as per the Indian Registration Act 1908. 2. In the instant case the grandfather's brother had sold one of the plots with joint unregistered agreement on a piece of paper that he would not claim any claim on the other plot of land in 1982, but since it was not registered it has no legal validity. 3. Because the agreement is unregistered, your grandfather's brother's name appears in the Jamabandi copy. 4. Since his name appears in the Jamabandi even to this day, he is claiming right over the property. 5. It's advised to amicably settle the matter out of Court."

Why is that ?AND OUR ADVOCATE WENT FOR APPEAL TO DISTRICT JUDGE COURT REGARDING THIS MATTER .So when I took second opinion about this situation The OTHER advocate said that ENHANCEMENT DOESNT FALL UNDER JUNIOR JUDGE AND WE SHOULD NOT PRESS IT ? SHE SAYS THAT THE DISTRICT JUDGE WONT ENHANCE THE MAINTENANCE ?I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO IN THIS SITUATION NOT PRESS OR CONTINUE THE APPEAL?

            "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. My team has dealt with various cases of such nature. After the rental agreement is printed on the stamp paper, each page of the stamp paper must be signed at the bottom by both the owner and tenant. Two witnesses must also sign the agreement along with their names and addresses to make the agreement valid. At present, the rental agreement executed looks to be legally valid. However detailed discussion is required with complete documents. There should not be any ambiguity in the terms and conditions mentioned in the agreement. Always mention the details of the fittings and fixtures in the property, in the rent agreement. Leave and License agreement can be prepared and drafted only after knowing the facts. Tax levied on legal documents in return for making them legally valid is called as Stamp Duty. In Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Govt. recommended Stamp Duty is as follows: -0 to 10 years – 0.4% of total rent payable in the lease -10 to 20 years – 0.6% of total rent payable in the lease -20 to 30 years – 0.8% of rent payable in the lease -30+ years – 5% of the total rent payable in the lease. You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification.",
            "Rental Agreement Validity: a. Is the rental agreement executed by the tenant's wife valid? Yes, the rental agreement executed by the tenant's wife is valid as long as she has the authority to sign the agreement on behalf of the family and the terms are agreed upon by both parties (you and the tenant). It’s common for the wife to sign on behalf of the family, especially if she is managing the household. b. Witness signatures: Yes, the rental agreement should ideally have witness signatures. Typically, it should include two independent witnesses who are not parties to the agreement. The witness can be anyone who is not directly involved in the contract, but ideally, they should be reliable individuals (friends, neighbors, or professionals). If the tenant's husband signs as a witness, it could be seen as a conflict of interest, so it's better to have an independent third party sign as a witness. Leave and License Agreement: In summary, the agreement signed by the tenant's wife is valid, but it’s best to have independent witnesses, and it’s advisable to seek a professional format for the Leave and License agreement.",

After passing of order in first motion allowing first motion second motion petition is to be filed as a fresh case mentioning details of first motion with order passed in first motion and thereafter, same procedure as was held in first motion is to be followed. If wife does not cooperate in second motion or does not attend second motion then it also amount to cruelty and only on this ground husband can file fresh case for divorce. Withdrawn cases can slso be restored. Being muslim and if marriage is performed under muslim law then only you can also pronounce talak on each tuhr to wife.",

We are 4 Brothers and 2 sisters In the year 1973 my father transferred 8 acres ownership to one of my brothers by submitting a report to the tahashildar Is that 8 acres of land not ancestral in nature? Can he give that land to only one of his sons? now can other brothers and sisters challenge it in the court to get our share?",
        "answers": [
            "1. To be classified as ancestral property, the property should have traversed for four generations without any break in the male lineage. 2. If the eight acres of land satisfies (1) above, then it's called ancestral property. 3. Based on above if it falls within the bracket of ancestral property, then he could not have given such land to only one of his sons. 4. If it were to be ancestral property, then the other brothers and sisters can challenge it in the competent Court to get their individual shares.",
            "It is not ancestral land Father can give land to one of his pms by executing gift deed",
            "Dear Client, In the Present Scenario, the 8 acres of land in question, are inherited by your father from his adoptive mother, and is hence not considered as an ancestral property, as such property refers to those passed through at least four generations of male lineage. Hence, this may be considered as a self-acquired property of your father, and therefore, he had an absolute right to transfer it to one of his sons, either through a gift, sale, or any other means. According to the Hindu Laws, a person has complete control over their self-acquired property, i.e., your father could legally give the land to one son without needing the consent of the other heirs. However, if the transfer was done in an improper way, without following proper legal documentation works, the other brothers and sisters may challenge the transfer in court. The same may be challenged on grounds of fraud, coercion, or mental incapacity. However, if the transfer has been done as a gift or through a will, there may be no challenge raised to the property ownership or transfer. On the other hand, if your father had passed away, without writing a will, the remaining heirs could seek their share of the property. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",
            "In this situation, the nature of the land (ancestral or self-acquired) is critical. Since your father received the 8 acres from his adopted mother, it is likely considered self-acquired property, not ancestral. Ancestral property typically passes down undivided through four generations and must remain intact through successive generations, which does not seem to apply here since the land came to him through adoption. As the property is considered self-acquired, your father had the legal right to transfer it to one son in 1973. However, if the transfer was not done with free consent or if there were any irregularities in the process, other siblings could potentially challenge the transfer in court. You may consult a lawyer to explore whether there’s any legal ground to question the validity of the transfer, but a claim on this land may be difficult if all legal protocols were followed and the property is deemed self-acquired. For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy. Hope you find the information helpful. You are free to contact me for further discussion.If you could spare two minutes of your time to write a review, It would be really grateful and very happy to read it. Thank you. Shubham Goyal",
            "No, it is not ancestral property, it becomes your father's own and absolute property hence he can transfer the same to any person of his choice and by any mode of transfer. The proposed challenge by the other siblings will not be tenable in law."

First, review your society's bylaws to see if they specify equal maintenance charges. If they do, this could support your case. You may also file a complaint with the Registrar of Societies against the association for non-compliance with the Act. If no action is taken, consider escalating this through a writ petition to the High Court. If informal resolutions fail, you can file a civil suit against the society for unfair maintenance fees. Additionally, if you believe your initial case was misinterpreted legally, consult a property lawyer about appealing to a higher court. Given that penthouse owners are a minority in your society, collective action may be necessary to influence changes. Ensure you keep thorough documentation of all communications and payments. Hope this answers your query.",

In that period, a registered gift deed or other formal documentation was required to transfer property ownership effectively. You can file a suit to set aside this unregistered transfer. File a Partition Suit: You may file a partition suit, naming your brother and any other legal heirs of your grandfather as parties. This would request a legal division of the property, and the court could examine the validity of your brother’s claim. Consider Limitation Periods: Be mindful of the limitation period, as significant time has passed. However, since you became aware of the transaction only recently, you might argue that the limitation period should begin from your discovery of the issue. Seek Injunction: To prevent your brother from selling or transferring the property, you can request an injunction restraining him from doing so while the suit is pending. Property Classification: Since the property was inherited by your grandmother from her husband, it would likely be considered her personal property, not ancestral. This can affect inheritance rights, but you and your brother could still have claims as her heirs.",

Despite stating that we then have no place to park and for health reasons purely we had moved, the committee (A) is unwilling to consider our situation even on humanitarian grounds and threatening us to tow our vehicle.

        "full_text": "Legal action against franchisee for business losses, fraud negligence, and data theft. Dear Kanoon.com Lawyers/Team, I am seeking legal advice on pursuing action against a franchisee in, India, who has directly contributed to substantial financial losses for my UK-based business. The Hyderabad franchise was officially registered as a franchise and was responsible for back-office operations, including sales, marketing, customer support, payment collections, and managing critical customer data on behalf of the UK company. Recently, the franchisee has become unresponsive, switching off their phones and seemingly absconding. In addition, they took important data (such as booking forms) from our shared systems and deleted much of this data, further impacting our ability to manage customer claims and finances. I have several questions regarding possible legal actions and the relevant sections under Indian law to address this serious situation: Grounds for Legal Action: What legal actions can I initiate in India for breach of contract, negligence in duties, potential fraud, and data theft, given that they failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to the UK company and are now absconding? Relevant Sections and Acts: Under which specific sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or civil contract law can I file a case? Are there specific provisions for: Negligence in fulfilling back-office duties (including customer support and collections) that led to financial harm? Absconding, fraud, and potential data theft, given their failure to transfer funds, safeguard critical data, or continue operations? Breach of contract, as they did not fulfill their agreed responsibilities, including preserving essential customer data? Process for Legal Action: Could you outline the process for filing a complaint or lawsuit against an absconding franchisee in Hyderabad, and what evidence will be crucial to support my case? Possibility of Criminal Charges: Given the franchisee’s unresponsiveness, deletion of data, and the resulting financial impact, would this case qualify for criminal charges? If so, could charges like criminal breach of trust (Section 406), cheating (Section 420), or data theft apply under the IPC? Recovery of Financial Damages: What options do I have to recover the financial losses and customer data that were compromised due to their negligence? Could the court order damages, restitution, or even require the retrieval of critical data if it can be located? Steps for Immediate Action: Since the franchisee is absconding and has deleted data, is there any immediate legal action (such as sending a legal notice or filing a First Information Report (FIR)) you would recommend to formally initiate the case, protect my interests, and prevent further loss? I would greatly appreciate any guidance you can provide on the above questions, as well as recommendations for the best course of action given the franchisee’s absconding status, deletion of data, and my priority to recover losses. Thank you for your advice",

            "Section 72 of the IT Act penalizes breaches of confidentiality and privacy, where access to electronic records or other material is obtained without the consent of the concerned person, resulting in disclosure to another party. On the other hand, IPC Sections 406, 408, and 409 pertain to criminal breach of trust by various categories of individuals, including public servants, clerks, or servants. IPC Section 405 defines criminal breach of trust as dishonest misappropriation or conversion of entrusted property for personal use. IPC Section 403 defines dishonest misappropriation as the wrongful conversion of movable property. If even one ingredient of an offence under the Indian Penal Code is missing in the act which has been made punishable under the special statute, the Indian Penal Code section will not be excluded and still can be resorted to albeit, the provisions of section 71 of the Indian Penal Code and section 26 of the General Clauses Act Therefore your options are to; i) lodge a criminal complaint with the local police station where the suspect is believed to reside or was residing; ii) You can ascertain the losses you suffered and can file a recovery suit to recover the losses and damages through civil court too simultaneously iii) For breach of contract conditions you can file a civil suit for specific relief too. The Specific Relief Act of 1963 in India allows a court to award compensation for a breach of contract if the court decides that specific performance is not enough to satisfy the case. The court will use the principles in the Indian Contract Act, 1872 to determine the amount of compensation.",

            "Playing on Dream11 or similar platforms does not fall under dual employment, as dual employment generally refers to holding two jobs with two different employers simultaneously. Dual employment would involve receiving salaries or wages from multiple employers, which is not the case here. Here's a breakdown to clarify: Section 194BA: This section relates to tax deducted at source (TDS) on winnings from online games like Dream11. The ₹3 deduction you see is TDS on the winnings, not employment income. It’s automatically deducted when your winnings cross a certain threshold, so it won’t affect your employment status. Form 26AS: Form 26AS is a consolidated statement of tax deducted, tax collected, and advance tax paid. TDS from online gaming platforms will appear here, but it’s listed under “Other Sources,” not “Salary.” This ensures it is clear it’s not employment income. Tax Implications: Income from Dream11 falls under income from other sources when you file your tax return, and it is not considered salary income or part of dual employment. In summary, this TDS deduction from Dream11 is unrelated to dual employment and simply reflects tax on your gaming winnings. You should report it as income from other sources when you file your tax return.",

I have been a victim of domestic abuse and dowry abuse and since has been living apart from my husband(he lives in another state) since 15 years.I filed for a maintanence during that time according to his salary which was 40,000 every month. and the maintenance amount provided as ordered by the court (2nd addl senior judge) in our state is rupees 7000 every month to me and my son accordingly in 2008 . So here comes the problem my husband works at a central government organisation and has recieved many promotions since then and has had increment of salary too many times but our advocate (for some reason idk?) didn't bother to file an enhancement even after repeated requests from me and my father up until 2019. In the year 2019 his salary has increased to rupees 1,70,000 a month and also he owned a few flats in other states. I also battled lukemia in the year 2016 which costed a hefty amount for treatment (24 lakh to be precise)and also with my son' increasing educational expenses every year we filed for an enhancement of maintenance to 70k per month to both of us in the state where we are but our lawyer instead of filing it with the (2nd addl senior judge) in continuation of the older case he filed in 3rd munisiff court (lower court than the 2nd one )and he said it is alright if it's filed anywhere. After 6 years of battling and we submitting all property documents he owned and his income certificate we weren't awared the maintenance ( we were only given a meagre increment of ₹10k per month). And also he is not upholding the monthly maintenance judgement given in 2008 and not sending us even the ₹7000 every month we always have to file an executive petition if he doesn't send the amount and that always takes 3YEARS to get just 1 YEAR of amount 60k to be precise after all the cross arguments and adjournments of the court, So I asked my advocate to send a letter to the Central Government organisation my husband works in reminding him the 2008 judgement to pay us regularly only to not recieve any response from them. I called them they transferred my call to the law department only to say to me that he is denying to pay it and it seems he only pays after we file an ep (intentionally wasting time and avoiding us) and also his salary is now 3,50,000 per month he has gone to a very high position too along with bonuses of 8 lakh. We also filed for an appeal for enhancement here in the state where we live in. So what do you think I should do? Do you think our lawyers at fault here? He won't pay heed to what we say and fumbled before the judge when she asked for some decisions as to why he didn't continue 1) continue with the appeal in district court in the state where we live ? 2) change the lawyer and transfer it to the state where my father works apparently theres some person inside who provided us with his salary certificate last time(he works at that organisation too)and he is willing to help us but he is asking to file a formal draft to him",

Legal Procedure to Cancel a Gift Deed Given to the Daughter by the Mother 2. Civil Court or RDO Court Due to Senior Citizen Status 3. Non-joinder of Necessary Parties 4. Validity of the Gift Deed Revoked Solely by Your Grandmother 5. Applicability of Section 23 of the Senior Citizens Act, 2007 6. Injunction Between Siblings in Family Property Disputes 7. Adding Your Grandmother as a Witness or Filing for Revocation 8. Use of Web History and MRO Office Records for Counter 9. Absence of Passbook or Documents by the Daughter In summary, it seems appropriate to proceed by challenging the gift deed in the RDO court due to her senior status and invoking Section 23 of the Senior Citizens Act. Also, consider approaching civil court to tackle the injunction and non-joinder issues while presenting strong evidence for your grandmother's claims.",

No one is above the law. Let me be clear - no one is above the law. Not a politician, not a priest, not a criminal and not even a police officer. We are all accountable for our actions. As per guidelines of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the validity period of cheque from the date of issue is 3 months.

Demanding the amount of the cheque within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice. When the drawer fails to repay the amount within 15 days from the service of the notice, the receiver can file a criminal complaint against the drawer u/s 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The complaint must be filed before the Magistrate within 30 days after the expiration of 15 days from the service of notice. The affidavit is filed and attached to the complaint. The Court examines the original documents and checks for validity and limitation of the complaint filed. The complaint can also be filed by the power of attorney of the complainant. After satisfaction, the court issues a summons against the accused, and the case is tried as a summary criminal proceeding. When the accused presents himself before the court, the court asks the accused to furnish surety and to submit bail bonds, in order to make certain that the accused will remain present on every date of the proceedings. The plea of the accused is recorded, and particulars are framed. At the stage of evidence, the complainant files all the original documents before the court, followed by an examination in chief and cross examination of the complainant. The complainant can give further witnesses if he wants to; otherwise, the evidence of the complainant is closed. Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, provides presumptions in favour of a complaint. Accused can rebut the presumption by taking a probable defence. After competition of complainant’s evidence, statement u/s 313 of Code of Criminal Procedure, of accused is recorded. Accused can give his witnesses if he wants to. After closing of evidence of both sides, arguments are heard by both parties and conducted by their respective counsels. Then the court pronounces judgement in open court. Furthermore, a criminal complaint can also be filed for early action and to build pressure on him. After the amendment of 2002, the term of imprisonment was extended to 2 years, or the fine, which may extend to double the amount of the cheque or both.

The cheque amount is 350000 Now the bank people have agreed to take back case if he pays 150000 .. How should be the legal course of actions now so that bank should not ask in future to the remaining amount and is there legal option for to file case against his friend to recover this amount of Rs 150000 .. And his friend also facing different case on the same loan What if bank recovers full amount from him in that case",

            "In such cases of OTS/OCS, after an agreement is reached, the bank usually calls for an offer letter from the borrower/guarantor expressing their willingness to pay the sum agreed in full quits on or before a set deadline. The bank will then give them an acceptance letter. Then, it becomes binding on both parties. However, if there is a default in payment, the bank shall be at liberty to set aside the OTS/OCS, and proceed further legally against the borrower/guarantor. If payment is done within time, the bank shall have no further recourse.",
            "Dear Client, In the Present Scenario, your relative is facing a criminal case in relation to cheque bounce, as he is a guarantor to a loan taken by his friend in a Cooperative Society Bank, wherein the amount came up to Rs. 3,50,000. Presently, the bank has agreed to take back the case if he pays back Rs. 1,50,000, and hence you wish to enquire on the legal course of actions to be taken so that the back does not ask you to pay the remaining amount, and if there is an option to recover the amount paid by you to the bank. Herein, firstly, it is suggested that your relative has a negotiation with a bank for a formal settlement and agreement of only up to Rs. 1,50,000 from your relative, and not ask the remaining Rs. 2,00,000 for the cheque bounce. With respect to the recovery of amount from his friend, your relative may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act or the Indian Contract Act, claiming that your relative is the guarantor and hence, entitled to recover the amount paid for his friend. To prevent from any future course of action, it is recommended that the statement, of bank to release your relative from recovering for further claims, is clearly documented. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",
            "- If your friend is agreed to pay the compromised amount to the bank , then the Cheque bouncing case under section 138 N.I.Act can be withdraw by the bank. - Your friend should mention to the Court at the time of withdrawn of the case to record the statement of the bank official that no other case will be filed by the bank for the said loan.",
            "A cheque bounce case can be initiated against the drawer of the cheque and the guarantor cannot be implicated in the cheque bounce case if he has not signed the cheque. If your relative has issued his personal cheque towards repayment of borrowed amount, then he should be worried about it because he would be liable for the offence of bouncing the cheque. In that case, it is not understood that how come bank is coming down to accept the amount reduced by more than 50% of the liable amount? If the bank is offering to withdraw the cheque bounce case on payment of the reduced amount then he can get it done through lok adalat by signing the terms in that context which the bank cannot withdraw at a later stage. Whatever, it is advisable that it should be clearly documented to avoid future litigation in this regard If it is a civil money recovery suit and if your relative had given any property as collateral security then as a guarantor he need to be worried about the non repayment of loan amount by the borrower because the bank has to first exhaust the recovery options from the borrower first."

However if the company has provided you specialised training by spending huge amount and/or sent you abroad for specialised training at it's cost, then the company will be at advantage. 3.

While you are ready for the Buyout option and pay for the same, they have declined it and told you to serve for a full notice period. But, however, you cannot serve for more than 2 months. With respect to your first query, as to whether they have the right to force you to serve the full notice period of 3 months, as the employment contract stipulates that there is a notice period of 3 months, the company generally has the right to enforce the same upon you. Unless there is an explicit clause stating for the early termination or buyout, the employer may force you to serve the full notice period. With regard to the second query, as to whether, if you serve only 2 months, then will they have the right to stop your reliving letter, although having one and a half years of experience in your current company, yes, there exists a possibility of the same as you have not served the complete notice period. For the third query, according to the Indian Contract Act, 1872, if you fail to fulfil the notice period as stipulated, the employer may have the right to seek damages from you.

Is it possible for the same petioner who filed the civil contempt case to file another criminal contempt case and pursue both civil and criminal contempt cases?",
        "answers": [
            "Criminal contempt can arise either from your actions or from publishing a matter which: (i) scandalizes or tends to scandalize, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court; or (ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of any judicial proceeding; or (iii) interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner; 2) criminal contempt is of a criminal nature. It encompasses acts such as wilful disobedience to Judges in Court, disrespectful behaviour towards Judges in open Court, defamation of Judges or Courts, interference with the judicial process, or any act that has the potential to prejudice the course of justice. A person is found guilty of criminal contempt when their conduct tends to bring disrespect to the authority and administration of the law or interferes with or prejudices litigants during the legal proceedings. 3) Civil Contempt\" as per Section 2 (b), pertains to the intentional refusal to comply with any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ, or other legal process of a Court, or the intentional violation of an undertaking given to the Court. 4) The Constitution Bench of Supreme Court in State of Bihar v. Sonabati Kumari [AIR 1961 SC 221] , held that the provisions of Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (for short \"the 1971 Act\") deal with the wilful defiance of the order passed by the court. Order of punishment be not passed if the court is satisfied that the party was, in fact, under a misapprehension as to the scope of the order or there was an unintentional wrong for the reason that the order was ambiguous and reasonably capable of more than one interpretation or the party never intended to disobey the order but conducted himself in accordance with the interpretation of the order. 5) it is necessary to peruse the circular and judgment to advice whether cone,tot or court proceedings are maintainable or not 6) if you have already filed civil contempt case doubtful whether criminal contempt case would be maintainable",
            "Contempt of court refers to the act of interfering with the administration of justice, which can take various forms and may result in the improper execution of justice. It is considered a serious offense that can lead to imprisonment, and it involves making false statements or interfering with the judicial proceedings. The main difference between civil contempt and criminal contempt in India is that civil contempt is a violation of a court order, while criminal contempt is an act that interferes with the administration of justice. In India, the punishment for civil contempt of court is as follows: Simple imprisonment for up to six months, A fine of up to two thousand rupees, and Both. The accused can be discharged or the punishment can be remitted if they apologize to the satisfaction of the court. The apology must be bona fide and not qualified or conditional Criminal contempt of court is different from civil contempt of court, which is usually used to enforce legal directives like child support payments. Criminal contempt of court is intended to punish misconduct, while civil contempt is intended to compel compliance. The punishment for criminal contempt of court is a fine of up to Rs 2,000, or simple imprisonment for up to 6 months, or both. However, this limit only applies to the High Courts, and the Supreme Court has more discretion in what punishment to give",

With respect to your first query, as to whether it is possible for any other who has similarly been affected to plead themselves into the civil contempt case, along with a criminal contempt petition, and thus pursue the case. According to the Civil Procedure Code, a person may be added as a party if their presence is deemed necessary for the proper and complete adjudication of the case. However, such party should have been directly affected by the actions of the statutory authority. With respect to the query as to whether the same petitioner who filed the civil contempt, will it be possible to file another criminal contempt case and pursue both cases together, it can be noted that, the same can be done as there is no bar to present a civil and a criminal case for the same fact situation. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",

Yes, the same petitioner who filed the civil contempt case can also file a separate criminal contempt petition if there are grounds for such a claim.",
            "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Third party (similarly affected) can be impleaded in the case. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has emphasized that Section 20 applies to civil and criminal contempts and would also apply to the contempt committed on the face of High Court or the Supreme Court or even Subordinate Courts. Therefore, with regard the instituting both together, the documents is to be examined. In an inter-party proceeding, orders of the Court bind only the parties to such proceedings. Therefore, violation of such orders by any of the parties to the proceedings may amount to contempt of Court, punishable in terms of the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. However, there may be instances where the violation/ disregard of Court's order results not only from the conduct of the parties to the proceedings, rather, from the conduct of persons totally unrelated thereto (\"third person\"). Under such circumstances, providing immunity to third person on pure technical grounds that the orders of Court bind only parties to the proceedings, would amount to permitting indirect assault on the majesty and supremacy of judiciary, which the Courts are bound to protect. Law on third party liability in contempt proceedings in India is primarily an adaptation of the principles of English Law. One of the earliest English cases discussing the liability of third party in contempt proceedings is that of Seaward v. Paterson, (1897) 1 Ch. 545. The Hon'ble Chancery Division, while acknowledging the difference between the person bound by order of Court and a person, though not bound by such order, but conducting himself in the manner so as to obstruct the course of justice, held, \"In the one case the party who is bound by the injunction is proceeded against for the purpose of enforcing the order of the Court for the benefit of the person who got it. In the other case the Court will not allow its process to be set at naught and treated with contempt.\" Similarly, Lord Denning in Acrow (Automation) Ltd. v. Rex Chainbelt Inc., (1971) 3 All ER 1175 held, \"The Court has jurisdiction to commit for contempt person, not a party to the action who knowing of an injunction, aids and abets the defendant in breaking it.\" The aforementioned principles were adopted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sita Ram v. Balbir alias Bali, (2017) 2 SCC 456, while imposing liability on third persons, aiding and abetting the contemnor in flouting the orders of the Hon'ble Court. The Hon'ble Madras High Court in Vidya Charan Shukla v. Tamil Nadu Olympic Association & Anr., AIR 1991 Mad. 323, while carrying out an exhaustive review of the case laws on the subject, observed, \"We can see thus clearly that the Courts in India invariably accepted the law applied in England and found (1) a party to the suit if he had notice or knowledge of the order of the Court and (2) a third party or a stranger, if he had aided or abetted the violation with notice or knowledge of the order of injunction guilty of civil contempt and otherwise found a third party guilty of criminal contempt if he has been found knowingly obstructing implementation of its order or direction..\" Conclusively, mere absence of law specifically providing for the liability of third party in contempt proceedings has not acted as a deterrent for the Courts to reprimand the violators of its orders, though, not specifically named therein or expressly bound by it. In fact, through the process of adoption and traversing the rugged terrains through years, Courts have developed a mechanism wherein no violator of its order/ injunction is left unpunished, even though not a party to a proceeding before Court. Clearly an act of violation of order of the order of Court or interfering with the administration of justice by third person amounts to contempt by such third person. As Lord Justice Eveleigh in Z LTD. v. A-Z AND AA-LL, [1982] Q.B. 558 observed, \"It is true that his conduct may very often be seen as possessing a dual character of contempt of court by himself and aiding and abetting the contempt by another, but the conduct will always amount to contempt of court by himself. It will be conduct which knowingly interferes with the administration of justice by causing the order of the court to be thwarted.\" Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents.

Incidentally my brother has two children who are of adult age, and I have a son who is also of adult age. By law all the three grand children do have their legal right of inheritance to their grandfather's flat. Questions: 1) Does my brother need to obtain any NOC from his children to gift his inheritance to his sister i.e. me? 2) Do I have to take any NOC from my son",

Now the share of each legal heir in the property will become their self acquired property respectively. Therefore the children of the said legal heirs have no rights in the property whatsoever and they cannot claim any share in it as a right, hence there's no necessity to obtain NOC from his children to relinquish his rights by your brother in the property in your favor, similarly your child also doesn't have any rights in your share of property.",

Does the tenant of a residential place risk any legal liability if he/she pays rent in cash, at the landlord's insistence, and only gets a phone message as acknowledgement of payment (no formal receipt)? For this question, please consider that it is not fully clear what the intentions of the landlord are in asking for payment in cash and refusing issue of any formal receipt of the rent, but they vaguely mentioned something to do with \"TDS\" to the tenant, and more details may come to light later. The landlord is ok to sign a lease deed signed in which the amount of rent will be mentioned. If relevant for this scenario, please consider that the rent is quite low, at around Rs. 10,000 per month. My question is if this arrangement is legally problematic from the tenant's perspective, if the tenant does not want to engage or participate in any financial or other wrongdoing but agrees to this arrangement because that's what the landlord prefers. In other words, is it possible that the tenant may be held liable for any financial concealment or wrongdoing by the landlord related to this arrangement? Thanks.",

There is also a possibility of your wife predeceasing you in which event you and your daughter will inherit your wife's 50% share. 7. Your requirement of your daughter succeeding to the flat after you and your wife die, is practically not possible, unless both of you die together. So when one spouse dies before the other, the daughter will inherit from the share of the deceased spouse and thus she cannot be excluded until after the demise of both spouse, unless both of them die together."

After the parents death a family of 5 members (2 brothers and 3 sisters) partitioned their agricultural land after executing a family settlement cum agreement on 15.11.2014 . A 12 feet road with a length of 240 metres has been in existence for several decades when it was a joint property. After division the entire road was passing through the younger brother’s land . Elder brother has to pass through that road to his farm land. Elder brother gave more than 1 acre of land to the younger brother towards road as a compensation. As a result elder brother got 7.38 acres and younger brother got 9 acres. Since that road was already existing, the road details were not mentioned in the family settlement. After division, the younger brother closed the existing road during October 2015 and provided an alternate road which passes through the lands of 4 different farmers without the consent of the elder brother, as he was away from the village since he was an employee. At the end of 2015, when the elder brother visited the village, he found that an alternate road was provided to reach his farm land. At that time the elder brother asked his younger brother to restore the then existing road and the younger brother readily agreed but not restored. Meanwhile, the younger brother died during March, 2016. Elder brother continued to use the alternate road. Recently there are disputes over the alternate road, as one of the farmer is making some objections. Elder brother wanted to restore the then existed road prior to 2016 but the younger brother’s family are objecting to it. They say that nothing is mentioned about road in the settlement agreement. Therefore they will not restore that road. There are several witness to the fact that the road existed as on 29.12.1994 because on that day the funeral procession passed through that road. Secondly, there are several witnesses to the fact that the father’s funeral procession had passed through the same road. Also the google images of that road as on 07.04.2014 and 30.10.2015 are also available. What are the options before the elder brother?

I will provide you with the details of the current situation and my query: The property in question was inherited by my father from my grandfather. After my father’s passing (without a will), my family and I are considering executing a partition deed. My family consists of five legal heirs: my mother (who is still alive), my three sisters, and myself. We are planning to divide the property equally with each receiving a 20% share (20% for each sister, 20% for my mother, and 20% for myself). However, my 2nd sister is demanding a 40% share of the property with the false claim that our father, during his lifetime, promised to give her 40% of the property. The rest of the family (myself, my mother, and my other two sisters) do not agree with this demand, and we believe this claim is unsubstantiated. In light of this, I would like to know if it is legally valid to execute a partition deed between my mother, my 1st and 3rd sisters, and myself, excluding my 2nd sister's share for the time being. Additionally, if such a partition deed is executed without my 2nd sister's consent or involvement, will I have absolute rights over my 20% share in the property? I would also like to understand the legal consequences of excluding my 2nd sister and whether she can challenge the partition in the future. I kindly request your guidance on the following: The legal validity of a partition deed executed without the consent of one legal heir (my 2nd sister).

            "Dear Client, Herein, you have been working in a Government College, at a teaching position. A female teacher from the Psychology department had made a complaint of sexual harassment with no specifics to the Internal Committee, against four male and three female teachers, including you. This complaint was posted by the teacher on Facebook and WhatsApp and on enquiry by the Internal Committee, oral complaints were made by the teacher that were mostly in relation to the administrative grievances, not of sexual harassment, except one complaint against you wherein it has been alleged that she has heard from someone that there are certain objectionable photos and videos of her in your mobile. When this was further enquired, she confessed to the fact that she hasn't seen any of them by herself and will not reveal the identity of the person who told about the same. Further, no evidence was also presented and the Committee submitted a report with baseless allegations. Now, you want to safeguard yourself against her actions of defaming you, along with others. Here, firstly, it is very significant that the detailed records are maintained of all the communications between you and the Complainant, the internal committee meetings and the social media posts made by her. Further, if the social media posts made are defamatory in nature, you can file a complaint to cease the same, as the claims made are baseless. Hence, it can be claimed that the provisions given under the Protection Under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, are misused by her. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",

Each loan is treated independently, and the bank may update its policies or assess the risk differently based on a buyer's profile, regulatory changes, or internal procedures. If the bank denies your loan because you do not possess those specific documents you can 1. Clarify the reason why the bank requested to have those documents, and try to solve this problem by discussing alternatives with the bank. 2. Approach the bank grievance redressal system and narrate the inconsistency in the requirement of documents. 3. File a suit in a civil court if the denial causes undue delay or results in pecuniary loss, but more than that, it is usually resorted to when all else fails. Nonetheless, it has to be remembered that there is no explicit guarantee of the approval of loan applications under the discretion of banks processing the same.

        "full_text": "Regarding one-time settlement of loan with State Bank of India. I am 73 years old, residing in Kollam. This is regarding my loan account with the State Bank of India, for which I availed a loan of INR 35,00,000 at an interest rate of 12.70% on May 15, 2015. I have been diligent in making the loan repayments, especially while I was still in employment in Gulf. Following my retirement in the mid of 2016 and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020-2022, I faced significant challenges that hindered my ability to make regular payments. Despite my best efforts to catch up on my dues, I have been unable to maintain the repayment schedule. Additionally, I have noticed that the bank has been increasing the interest rates (rate of interest increased from 12.70% to 16% by June 2024) which has resulted in the escalation of my Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI). While I have made considerable payments towards my loan, the continuous hike in the interest rates has dramatically affected my net outstanding amount, resulting in substantial dues once again. I sought the help of the SBI top management to consider waiving some interest during the 2022-2023 period. I personally met with AGM, LHO, Trviandrum and AGM, RASMEC, Kottarakkara, and explained my situation. I was informed that there was no possibility of waiving or discounting the interest unless my loan becomes a Non-Performing Asset (NPA). Since June 2023, my wife and I have been experiencing serious health issues. The sudden decline in my wife’s health led to her immediate hospitalization at KIMS Health, Trivandrum, on June 17, 2023, which turned our lives upside down. She was diagnosed with a stroke, resulting in right hemiplegia and aphasia. She was treated and brought back home in a paralyzed state (whole right body). On January 1, 2024, I fell and broke my leg, resulting in fractures of both bones in my right leg. I was treated with ORIF (Open Reduction and Internal Fixation) using bridge plating with a lateral tibial locking plate. Since June 2023, we have been completely dependent on our children for our food and medication. Additionally, they have assisted me in repaying my loan. Overall, I have paid a total of INR 42,45,445 towards my loan as of July 2024. Recently, I have been receiving frequent visits from bank officials, which creates considerable discomfort for us. They often speak harshly and have threatened me with severe consequences. Despite my several attempts to negotiate a full and final settlement of my loan, the accumulated interest continues to increase my liability further. I am completely confused by the intermittent changes in the interest rate since May 2015 from i.e. from 12.70% to 16%. I have emailed my situtation to many big shots of SBI including Deputy General managers. I have requested one time settlement. No one has replied to my email so far but some of the SBI representantives often call me and threaten me of legal proceedings. Kindly advise me a suitable way out.",

            "Dear Client, Considering the health and age-related condition and financial condition of your case, it would be a better option to approach the SBI bank for a one-time settlement. According to Indian banking law and RBI guidelines, when the account becomes an NPA on grounds of genuine reasons when the borrowing is not repaid, the bank may provide the option of OTS. However, since your account has not been classified yet as NPA, this might be the reason your plea for the settlement was rejected in the first place. First, you have to ask the bank to restructure the loan considering your health and financial conditions. You can reach the grievance redressal cell of the bank, and lodge a written complaint with the bank regarding how the interest rates on your account are being increased arbitrarily, how your health issues have aggravated, and how things are going financially in the current situation. Also, you must mention to them the amount that has already been paid, which is INR 42,45,445 and make them understand that it is not possible to continue the repayments. If the officials at the bank are persisting with harassment, then report this to the Banking Ombudsman, Reserve Bank of India. The Ombudsman takes complaints on issues related to banking services, including harassment by officers and failure to process your requests appropriately. Other than that, you can even go to court to inform the bank officials of mental harassment and even threats of a lawsuit without first considering good possible solutions. I hope this explanation resolves your doubts effectively. If you still have any further queries regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact us again.",

Background: I have a personal loan that was recently written off by the bank due to financial difficulties, and I also have two car loans, one of which is being handled by my brother. The car is registered under my name but used by my brother, who had been paying the EMIs until recently. Unfortunately, my brother missed three consecutive EMIs, which led to the bank seizing the car. The car was seized directly from the road by bank employees, and passengers, including my brother, were left stranded without any prior notice of the seizure. This incident has caused a great deal of inconvenience. Communication with the Bank: I reached out to the bank manager and offered to immediately pay the three outstanding EMIs for the car to have it released. However, the manager refused my offer, stating that due to my personal loan being in default (now written off), I must either: Pay the complete outstanding balance of the personal loan and the three missed EMIs for the car loan, or Settle the entire outstanding amount of the car loan in full to have the car released. The bank also informed me that they would not issue a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for the car until the personal loan is fully cleared, despite my prior discussions about settling the personal loan separately. My Concerns: Seizure Without Prior Notice: The car was seized without any prior notice, and passengers were left on the road, which raises concerns about whether the bank followed the proper legal procedures for repossession. Unreasonable Conditions for Car Release: The bank is linking the release of the car and the issuance of the NOC to the repayment of my personal loan, which seems unjustified given that the car loan and personal loan are separate. can you help me what to do",

            "A bank can seize a vehicle if the borrower defaults on loan repayment EMIs, but they must follow the proper procedure: Lenders typically initiate repossession after 60 to 90 days of missed payments. Lenders must comply with the SARFAESI Act and RBI guidelines. They must also provide reasonable notice to the borrower before selling the asset. Banks and finance companies cannot use recovery agents to forcefully seize vehicles. The Supreme Court has ruled that the recovery process must be in accordance with law and not by use of force.

A loan write-off is when a lender recognises that a loan or debt has become uncollectible and removes it from their financial records as an asset.

However, it doesn't mean the borrower is no longer liable for the debt. The lender can continue to pursue debt recovery through legal action or debt collection agencies. 4. A bank cannot use another account of a defaulter to recover a personal loan unless they follow a legal process.

Question: Is it possible to file an appeal against an order issued by the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD) under the RPwD Act, 2016 at High Court, or is a writ petition in the High Court the only option? As a person with 90% blindness, I am looking for clarification on the legal process for challenging CCPD orders. Does the RPwD Act, 2016, provide any specific provisions for appeals, or is a writ petition in the High Court the best way forward? Any references or insights on this matter would be helpful. Workplace Discrimination and CCPD’s Role in Addressing Retaliation I am a 90% blind government employee, and during a meeting, a senior colleague called me incapable in front of others. I reported the incident to my reporting authority within 3 days via email, but no action was taken, and no committee was formed. Instead, after 8 months, I was sent on a punitive transfer, which I believe was in retaliation for reporting the incident. I filed a case with CCPD, but their order merely referenced Section 92(a) of the RPwD Act without taking any concrete action. Given this, is there still a chance for me to seek justice, and what legal options do I have at this stage?",

            "section 84 of RPWD act provides For the purpose of providing speedy trial, the State Government shall, with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court, by notification, specify for each district, a Court of Session to be a Special Court to try the offences under this Act.",
            "Dear Client, Sorry to hear about your condition. According to the RPwD Act, 2016, while filing an appeal against any order passed by the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD), the act does not consist of an appellate provision to appeal against the CCPD’s order. Thus, the conventional legal treatment would be to move to the higher court by filing a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and praying for judicial review of the CCPD’s decision. This approach is taken when Challenging quasi-judicial orders that do not provide a statutory right of appeal. A writ petition would enable you to appeal the decision on the different grounds such as illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety. The High Court has jurisdiction to consider whether or not the CCPD complied with the law and whether the procedural fairness was complied with or not. CCPD orders are of administrative nature, thus, in case of extreme need you can apply for a writ of certiorari or mandamus depending on the kind of relief you want. In regards to workplace discrimination and retaliation your rights are protected under the RPwD act especially section 20 that deals with nondiscrimination in employment, However,with 90% blindness, finding employment is still a vital challenge. If the CCPD has not provided sufficient relief, the High Court can be contacted for enforcing your rights and for handling the punitive transfer, perhaps for requesting a stay with regard to the transfer in addition to discrimination and retaliation. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",

Accordingly we filled the Form of Application for Membership at Appendix – 23 wherein my brother signed as First Applicant and me as Second Applicant. My mother also submitted Form of Application for Transfer (Appendix – 21) wherein our names are listed in same order as our Application in Appendix 23. Society is refusing to issue the Share Certificate in the Order as desired by us and is insisting that it is the Gift Deed that they will issue the certificate.

Associate, Joint or provisional Member. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 22, the society may admit any person as an associate, joint or provisional Member. (2) Right to vote and contest the election shall be subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of section 154B-11. 154B-11. Voting rights of Member. (1) No Member of society shall have more than one vote in its affairs: Provided that, every right to vote shall be exercised personally: Provided further that, in the case of an equality of votes, the Chairman shall have a casting vote in the meeting of a society. (2) The Associate Member shall have right to vote with prior written consent of a Member. (3) The provisional Member shall have right to vote. (4) In case of joint Member the person whose name stands first in the share certificate, shall have right to vote. In his absence, the person whose name stands second, and in the absence of both, the person whose name stands next and likewise, who is present and who is not a minor, shall have right to vote. (5) In case of Association of society, authorised Member of member society shall have right to vote. (6) In case of company or firm or any other body corporate or local authority or any legal body constituted under any law for the time being in force, the authorised director or person or any one of the partners as appointed by the firm, shall have right to vote. Section 22 and section 23 sub-sections 1 to 3 have been made applicable to co-operative housing societies by virtue of s.154B(1) Section 22 - Person who may become member (1 ) Subject to the provisions of section 24, no person shall be admitted as a member of a society except the following, that is to say-- (a) an individual, who is competent to contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872; (b) a firm, company or any other body corporate constituted under any law for the time being in force, or a society registered under the societies Registration Act, 1860; (c) a society registered, or deemed to be registered, under this Act; 1 [(d) the State Government or the Central Government;] (e) a local authority; (f) as public trust registered under any law for the time being in force for the registration of such trusts; 8[(g) the depositor or the financial service user] : ----------------- (2 ) Where a person is refused admission as a member of a society, the decision (with the reasons therefore) shall be communicated to that person within fifteen days of the date of the decision, or within three months 5 [from the date of receipt of the application for admission, whichever is earlier. If the society does not communicate any decision to the applicant within three months from the date of receipt of such application the applicant shall be deemed to have been [admitted] as a member of the society.] 7 [If any question arises whether a person has become a deemed member or otherwise, the same shall be decided by the Registrar after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to all the concerned parties.] Section 23 - Open membership (1) No society shall, without sufficient cause, refuse admission to membership to any person duly qualified therefor under the provisions of this Act and its by-laws. (2) Any person aggrieved by the decision of a society, refusing him admission to its membership, may appeal to the Registrar 5[within a period of sixty days from the date of the decision of the society]. 3[Every such appeal, as far, as possible, be disposed of by the Registrar within a period of three months from the date of its receipt: Provided that, where such appeal is not so disposed of within the said period of three months, the Registrar shall record the reasons for the delay.] (3) The decision of the Registrar in appeal, shall be final and the Registrar shall communicate his decision to the parties within fifteen days from the date thereof. Thus s.154B-1 clause (b) defines who is a Joint Member. It only says that the joint member has share right title and interest in the flat jointly. It nowhere says that the order of names has to be the same as in the instrument of transfer. Thus the only requirement is that the joint member should have a share right etc in the flat jointly with another. u/s 154B-4(1) the society can admit ANY person as the joint member. It does not state that only the person whose name stands second in the instrument of transfer [in your case the gift deed] can be admitted as a joint member the voting rights of joint members are also provided in s. 154B-11 (4) thus if the society has communicated its reasons against transfer of membership to the joint names in the order desired by you, then you will have to appeal to the registrar u/s 23(2) and if there is no communication by the society about its refusal to admit the joint members as stated in the application then they would be deemed to become the members of the society by virtue of s.22(2) after the expiry of the statutory period stated therein",
            "Dear Client, Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and relevant bye-laws, it is the Gift Deed alone that forms the primary document for ownership transfer in a cooperative society which records legal transfer of title. It can be deemed justifiable as the very suggestion by the society to issue the share certificate as mentioned in the Gift Deed is a reflection of the legal status of ownership. The order of the names in the Gift Deed is what reflects the intention of the transferor, and in updating their records, the law compels the society to oblige by the same. While the application form (Appendix 23) allows you to specify the priority of members for listing purposes, for all legal purposes, including ownership, the Gift Deed is paramount. Under the laws governing cooperative housing societies, both are coowners who hold their shares equally, regardless of which one is first and which second on the application form. If the society misreads the application and labels the second-named member as an \"Associate Member,\" they are, in fact, full members with equal rights. If you are still facing problems at any point in the future, remedy may be available through consulting the society registrar or Rule 56 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Rules, dealing with voting rights, co-members' rights, and election procedures. Your option filled in your application form is also important for administrative reasons, though it will not supersede the legal order of ownership established under the Gift Deed. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",
            "The association is right in mentioning that they will record the names in the order of the registered title deed (gift deed), therefore there should not be any issue to dispute the action of the association. As you cannot change the order of names in the gift deed now, it would be better that you accept the law of the association. Whether or not, you both are entitled to a share in the property equally as a right by the virtue of the registered gift deed on both the names. In the event of attending the AGM or participating in an election you may authorize him to act on your behalf."

As per the notification, if the local panchayat population, as per the 2011 Census, is less than 3,000, the proposed building must be situated 220 meters from the state highway.

Referring to Rule 5 Sub-rule (1), he submitted that the object behind Rule 5 Sub-rule (1) is to prevent the sanction of licence of sale of liquor near such places, which otherwise could be against morality, tranquility, decency, safety and against the public interest.

My family and GhansShaym's family are registered as joint owners in that land. Currently both families are cultivating that land such that, orientation of the property is such that on one side there is a main road, and all three sides the land is bounded by private lands. GhanShyam's family is cultivating the entire portion which is adjacent to the main road and we are cultivating the backward portion and my grandfather had constructed a tubewell in the bottom right corner of the land which was used to irrigate the entire land as well as other neighboring lands. Ghanshyam's family members have started to sell their portion to which we objected, and hence a partition suit was filed since the khasra number is the same and we demanded the land to be divided equally such that each party gets the fair share of the main road. Patwari has also prepared kurre giving every co-owner the share on the main road. My uncle has objected to the Kurre stating that he has kabza on the entire front portion and land was already divided 50 years back and they left a easement way for us to access the main road which is lie, and no written agreement or government record exists stating that. My question is: q1. will the land be considered divided or undivided? q2 courts generally prefer historical patterns on equal distribution? q3 whose position is stronger, I want equal distribution of the land and they want to just give us an easement way? q4 How much time these cases generally take ?",

            "I don’t understand your query",
            "Dear Client, In your case, this agricultural land appears to be undivided legally because no written agreement exists or a government record confirms that the land has been divided between your family and Ghanshyam's family earlier. According to Indian laws related to property and partition, not having any document with such registration for partition deeds also enhances your position to demand equal and just distribution of your share in the land. Since, no written or registered agreement documents the partition that occurred 50 years ago, the court will most likely treat the land as undivided. That would make it possible to partition the land now through the legal process. Courts generally seek a just division of jointly held property, and because access to the main road is critical to the value of the land, the partition likely will occur on an equal division principle. On the other hand, patwari's kurre also suggests equal shares on the main road. Your case is stronger due to the fact that there is no proof or official document of the government that exists for their claim of initial division. A formal agreement or official record mostly happens in partition-related cases and the absence of such written evidence weakens their case. This is further supported by your argument against their selling the land, as well as Patwari's suggestion to partition in your favor. Cases involving partition might take 2-5 years or even more depending on the complexity of the case and how crowded the judicial schedule is. Therefore, you will want to create all records and proof related to the case as it can go as far as no written agreement before making a case for fair partition; there may also be an injunction that does not allow the sale or transfer of the land until the court finalizes the partition. I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely. If you still have any queries regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact us again."

Secondly, the payment of the token advance signifies the buyer's intention to proceed with the purchase. Thirdly, though there has been an initial acknowledgment made, the same cannot be taken as a agreement under the Contract Act, unless it fulfils all the essential elements of the same, including the addition of forfeiture clause, consequences of non-execution of the agreement, and so on. However, it can be taken as a binding document on both parties, as the same has been entered into with their mutual consent. Furthermore, the mention on the 90-days clause, may be that, if the buyer does not pay the agreed-upon amount or execute within the given timeline, the agreement may be considered unfulfilled, thus giving the right to you, to forfeit the token advance, being a common legal practice in case of a default, and find for new prospective buyers after notifying the same to the present buyer on the cancellation due to non-fulfilment of the agreement entered into. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",

However you are at your liberty to cancel the deal if the buyer is not honoring the commitment on or before the stipulated time period but remember that you may have to return the token money to him otherwise he may sue you for either recovery of that amount or may even file a suit for specific performance of contract claiming execution of sale deed. ."

I purchased a 3-bedroom flat in the new building and don't own a car, but I want a parking slot as I plan to sell the flat and for a 3-bedroom flat, it makes sense to sell it with a parking slot.

The society has all the rights when first established to allot the parking slots fairly and in a clear manner, normally either through a lottery system or even an equal distribution. You can ask for the society to use some criteria, such as considering your ownership of a 3-bedroom flat and applying it in order to allocate a parking slot appropriately, or whatever other equitable method may apply. If such a fair solution is not provided then, you can raise a dispute with the Cooperative Court or under relevant provisions of MOFA so that proper demand allocation will be made.

            "Dear Client, Here is possible response to your queries If the 15-year restriction under the Bagar Hukum scheme with respect to alienation has elapsed, and the due legal formalities, including conversion from agricultural to non-agricultural use, mutation, and layout have been duly followed, you might pursue the purchase. Subject to the same, being erstwhile a gomala land and lying at a distance of 5 km from the TMC, it shall not raise much problem if the land has legally been converted under the relevant master plan for being suitable for non-agriculture purposes. On the face of it, the landowner seems to have completed the formalities right - getting the layout cleared by BIAPPA and then getting individual Khatas for the plots. It is, however, important that all mutation, conversion order and approval of layout documents get legal verification by a property lawyer before acquiring them, so that no existing issues pending on the status of the land as gomala or other local restrictions are left to be resolved after the purchase. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",
            "Gomala land is a government-owned and designated area specifically for grazing land for livestock and cannot be sold. It is meant to serve the community's needs, particularly those who rely on farm animals. In the present case even though the gomala land was mutated after 15 years of purchase and the land has been converted to non agricultural land, the risk in this is that : The PTCL Act came into force on 01.01.1979. Section 4(1) of the Act reads as under:-\"4. Prohibition of transfer of granted lands.- (1) Notwithstanding anything in any law, agreement, contract or instrument, any transfer of granted land made either before or after the commencement of this Act, in contravention of the terms of the grant of such land or the law providing for such grant, or sub-section (2) shall be null and void and no right, title or interest in such land shall be conveyed or be deemed ever to have conveyed by such transfer.\" It is very clear from the above provision of Section that if any transfer of granted land is alienated, which is contrary to the Land Grant Rules, will be null and void.If the original grantee is filing an application under section 5 of the act, with regard to terms of Section 5 of the Act which enables any interested person to make an application for having the transfer annulled as void under Section 4 of the Act. the court can pass an order declaring the sale or the transaction as null and void. However the supreme court has ruled in favor of the purchaser stating that the land was alienated after 15 year of allotment to the grantee hence any application made resumption of land the same is not maintainable. . You may obtain a legal opinion from a local lawyer having expertise in this subject and proceed if recommended.",

        "full_text": "Tenant eviction from commercial complex. Hi We have 25 year old commercial shopping complex in a good locality based in tamil nadu and there are around 15 tenants (13 tenants are individual proprietorship based small shops, 1 is restaurant taken by LLP entity and 1 is phamacy pvt limited company )- Most of them have been tenants for 15 years. Our plan is to vacate the tenants, demolish this shopping complex and reconstruct and let it out for large format shops. We normally sign 11 months agreement and tenants are unwilling to vacate after the agreement even if we are ready to offer compensation to move to other place. Since the rent is very nominal compared to neighboring places and they have been occupying for 15 years, they deny to vacate. with the intention to vacate legally leveraging the new tenancy act, all the recent renewals with the existing (for 11 months) and registered in tenancy portal and initiated eviction case against 4 of the tenants (post the agreement duration) under the new tenants act \"The Tamil Nadu Regulation of Rights and Responsibilities of Landlords and Tenants Act, 2017\" . We have sought eviction on the grounds for using the shop for personal (owners use). the tenants are unnecessarily dragging the case- after the initial 2/3 adjournments , our advocate is filling memo to expedite the case since as per the act the case need to be completed in 90 days . Complex owner is my father who is 76 years old and we have stated this also as reason for speedy execution in the memo filed. But desptie this, we see each case could take atleast 8 months to 1 year to complete and even if we win the case, tenants are ready to appeal in higher court just so that they can keep enjoying the property. Tenants intention is that they will keep dragging the case so that we give up on them and let them continue. I'm humbly Seeking your legal opinion - 1. for the upcoming renewals (after the completion of currently) - is there any alternate form of agreement (corporate agreement or license agreement) we can sign up with the existing tenant that will enable us to speedily vacate through police. 2. Is there any way where we get proactively intiate eviction court proceddings like 6 months before agreement date asking for judgement to vacate the property at the date of closure of agreement 2. Does leave and license agreement help the landlords to take over possession immediately after the agreement expiry and what is the procedure to enforce this at the end of agreement duration 3. In case if we have vacate all the tenants (after their respective tenant period) at once sighting reconstruction as reason - how can we proceed with that - our build is 25 years and can we get structural engineer opinion to demolish the property or can we sight reconstruction for our business purpose and file eviction. can the tenants file suit to stall this plan please let me know if there are any other suggestions to easily vacate the property by drafting the renewal agreements in favour of us",
        "answers": [
            "1) police would not intervene as it is a civil case 2) you have to follow due process of law and file eviction suit 3) even on expiry of leave and licence agreement if licensee fails to vacate you have to file eviction suit 4) if building is in bad condition obtain structural engineer certificate that premises are in dilapidated condition and request tenants to vacate",
            "1. Police cannot interfere in civil nature cases , and hence you cannot take assistance from the police even they will sign the same. - However, such admission can be produced before the Court for vacating them. 2. This depend upon the burden of the Court to give time on that eviction case , however if there is much delay then you can approach the higher court for directing the trial court to finish the matter within a short period of time. 3. You can declare the building as dangerous after approaching the municipal corporation , and then the said authority can evict the tenant on this ground.",
            "Dear Client, Here is the possible response to your queries 1. Agreement Form: The leave and license agreement throws the tenants out of the premises sooner without any rights but also offers police assistance in retrieving the property when the license term expires. 2. Proactive Eviction: Normally, eviction proceedings rely on valid grounds on or after the lease expires. Thus, pre-expiration filing is hard. 3. Leave and License: It makes it easier to obtain eviction upon expiry of the agreement through legal notices and, if required, filing for repossession in court. 4. Rebuilding-Based Eviction: You can file an eviction case based on the fact that rebuilding is proposed under the Tamil Nadu Rent Act, with a structural engineer's report for the demolition purpose. Tenants may claim but the court is likely to accept landowners' petitions claiming genuine rebuilding purposes. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",
            "1. If you are not willing to accommodate the tenant anymore then there is no question of renewing the rental agreement after expiration of the current tenure. The police will not interfere in the rent control matter since it is a civil matter. 2. There is no provision in law to enforce your desire in this regard, you may have to follow the procedures of law. 3. You have to file an eviction suit under the latest law in this connection which is the best option before you since your rental agreement is renewed periodically by a registered document, You can cite that demolition and reconstruction as the ground for eviction"

        "full_text": "Leaving in Pagdi System in Chawl for more than 32 Years. Hi All, My father has purchased a room in Chawl under the pagdi system in the year 1992, and at that time the landlord was coming and collecting rent on time, and we have the rent receipt as well for that time. But in the year 1997 our landlord died and he was having no one in his family. So no one has came to collect rent till the year 2015. But in the year 2015, one of his legal heir has came and started asking for the rent for all the pending years, we have around 25 rooms in that chawl and he has started asking rent from all the room owners. We all were ready to pay the rent but have asked him to show the legal heirship documents if he has but he has refused to show. Now in the year 2017, he has sent summon to 4 room owners and filed a case that we are not paying rent, we all 4 room owners went in court but he was never coming for hearing . After 6 hearing, my father and otehr room owners got fed up and stopped attending the hearing, meanwhile around the pandemic time, our lawyer also passed away. Nor before a week, landlord has again sent us a summon that we are not attending any hearings and in the summon he has mentioned to pay all the rent with interest and vacant the place within 30 days for receving the summon. We all 4 room owners are always ready to pay the rent if he shows his legal ownership. He has also filed that we have constructed the 1+1 room, without his & BMC permission in the year 1999, but he was not even available a that time. Why he has sent summon to only 4 of us and not to all the room owners. Many room owners has build up 1+1, without permission than why we only 4 rooms. What will be the outcome of this case in the court. We have a hearinf on 23rd of October.",

            "You may engage the services of a new advocate and appear before the court on the date of hearing and challenge the case properly. You can insist the court to instruct him to prove his succession to the property by documentary evidence.",
            "Ideally the tenant is to approach the landlord for paying the rent The tenant is required to show his readiness and willingness to pay the rent on time If the landlord stopped coming to the building to collect rent, then the tenant ought to have approached the landlord for paying the rent The tenant must show and prove that he made all inquiries to find the whereabouts of the landlord or his heirs If the heirs could not be traced, the tenant ought to have deposited the rent in the Small Causes Court to show his bonafides and willingness to pay the rent However it appears that in your case none of the above was done Just because someone claiming to be the heir of the landlord appeared after 8 years, the tenant cannot be heard to say that since no one from the landlord's end came in the building to collect rent for the last 8 years, that's why the tenant didn't take any steps to pay the rent. The obligation to pay rent is on the tenant. The landlord has got no legal obligation to go to the building and collect rent from his tenants So I am afraid that in your case the judgment will be passed against the tenant for being in arrears of rent and for not taking any positive steps to tender the rent to the landlord to show the tenant's readiness and willingness to pay rent If there was any doubt about the person claiming to be the heir of the landlord, the tenant ought to have deposited rent in court until such person produced an heirship certificate. This was not done. So mostly likely the tenants will suffer an eviction decree As regards the unauthorized construction, that too cannot be justified by saying that why only 4 tenants are targeted and why not others who have also made such unauthorized extensions and alternations. If the tenant is in breach of the tenancy terms and Municipal law , he cannot be heard to say that he is entitled to commit such breach since others have committed it too So on the ground of making unauthorized changes to the tenanted premises as well the tenant will suffer an eviction decree I must inform you that prior to the filing of the suit the heir must have issued a statutory demand notice u/s 15. So the tenant has got 2 opportunities to pay the arrears of rent and avoid an eviction decree for the time being. One is when he tenders the rent to the landlord within the statutory period mentioned in the statutory demand notice and another is when the tenant deposits the rent in court within the set time limit after receiving court summons Also you cannot take the plea that the claim of arrears of rent is barred by limitation since there are Bombay High Court judgments which have held that the tenant has to deposit the time barred rent claims as well to avoid eviction. So your case appears to be quite weak",
            "engage a lawyer to appear on your behalf deposit rentals in court file detailed reply",
            "Dear Client, I would like to inform you that,under the Pagdi system, you are being protected under the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. If the landlord's legal heir is demanding rent from you, he must prove first his legal ownership- succession certificate or legal heirship documents. You are entitled to ask for proof before paying rent. Regarding the notice, you must appear at court. The legal successor may try to make a case of non-payment to make the case for eviction; but by proving that you are willing to pay once the legal ownership is clear, this will go in your favor. The charge of construction without permission (1+1) would be a valid ground to create a case under Section 16(1) of the Act if one includes that this was done without the appropriate permissions from BMC. Since you are not alone and there are other tenants in the same situation, you can move this to court. Recommend getting a new lawyer to prepare for your case at the hearing on 23rd October. The court will then proceed to determine whether the landlord has satisfied his duties of establishing his ownership prior to ordering any eviction or back rent pay order. Thank you. Hope this answers your query."

I have given him final time of 15 days to vacate the house, post which I told him I will be starting my renovation works irrespective of whether he moves or not to which he agreed. Now I also told him that I would be using my house for office purposes for my business, so would be converting the electricity connection from residential to commercial and starting my renovation work at the house in 15 days no matter whether he moves out or not.

My father directly recruited as teacher(Group B) and my mother joined as Consolidate BT assistant in 2004 and got regularized in 2006. From 2004-2006 she got the fixed pay of 4000 without any allowances like DA etc. After 2006 when she got regularised she came under group b category. Then what will be her group while joining(As she joined with colsolidated pay does she comes under group C). And am i eligible for OBC NCL if my father is group b and my mom is group b promoted from group c?",

            "1) appointment letter issued by your mother employer would mention which grade your mother joined 2) you would be eligible for OBC NL if mother joined in group C and got promoted to group B 3) as per the Central creamy layer criterion II & III dated 08.09.1993 only the sons and daughter of following “government servants” will be treated as creamy-layer. (i) Parents, either of whom is a Group-A officer. (Direct Recruitment) (ii) Parents, both of whom are Group-B officers.

If anyone of, father or mother is direct recruited class 1 servants than their children won't be eligible for NCL. But if he/she is promoted to class 1 then the kids will be eligible 2. If both of the parents are class 2 then their kids won't be eligible for OBC quota , and in case of one only , then the child would be off from creamy layer and they can avail benefits of quota 3. If father was recruited direct to class 2 positions and then prompted to class 1 before age of 40 than it would be no longer NCL. However this scenario only applies to father not the mother - The government servants who don’t fall under this category are all non-creamy layer. - Government Employees of Class 3 or below class 3 officers are eligible for OBC Quota., and the salary/ income of the government employees are not to be taken into consideration for considering the OBC NCL category certificate. - Since your father is under group B m, and mother is promoted in group B, then you are eligible to get non-creamy OBC Certificate.",
            "Dear Client, In your case, your mother was recruited as a Consolidated BT Assistant in 2004 on a fixed pay, which probably categorizes her under Group C at that time, since consolidated pay is more or less associated with lower categories. However, the moment she was regularized in the year 2006, she was placed under Group B, as that indicated her position after regularization with pay scale benefits and allowances. For OBC-NCL Eligibility: If your both parents are Group B officers and no one of your parents has been promoted to a higher level than Group B, you fall within the category of OBC-NCL according to the eligible criteria of the Government of India. You may visit the official website for guidelines on parental employment in Group B with reference to OBC-NCL. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",

All other Officers i.e. if only one of the parents is a Group B/Class II Officer and all the Officers below the Category II Officers are entitled to avail the rule of reservation unless their other income other than the salaries and agricultural land exceeds the income criteria limit prescribed."

        "full_text": "Neighbor wants NOC to get plan sanction in Gurugram. I have a plot in Gurugram, Haryana. My neighbor ( immediately adjoining plot ) wants to construct Stilt + 4 floors building on his land and is asking from NOC from neighbor, as is required under Haryana construction laws for plan sanction, - this includes a question as to whether I have any objection to him building a basement. I have a small residential unit on my plot, with no basement, - my concern is if he makes basement he should not disturb my building foundation. Secondly, even more importantly, I will myself require consent of adjacent property owners when I need to get plan sanctioned for constructing a full stilt + 4 floor structure, even though after 3-4 years. Is there an enforceable legal mechanism under which I can get a written undertaking from the neighbor that he promises to grant me written consent, when I require it in future, when I build a full building ? Another point is that the present neighbor is in all likelihood a builder who will sell the property floor wise and 3-4 years from now, he will be out and there will be 4 different owners. In that likely scenario, will any such undertaking have any value ? Is it legally possible and enforceable to include a clause in the undertaking that any future sale agreement / sale deed that the neighbor will execute with respect to part of the property will include this undertaking, making the undertaking binding on future owners of part or whole of the property ? At least for the basement, I can ask him to promise in writing that he will leave 2 feet area undisturbed when he makes basement so my foundation is not disturbed . This query is practical- if I do ask my neighbor something in return for my consent, it should be legally feasible and enforceable, should be of practical legal value, otherwise it will spoil the atmosphere unnecessarily and embarrass me. Or should I, gracefully, just ask that his construction should not disturb my construction and give my consent ? I want to be co operative and a good neighbor but if there is a legally enforceable document I can ask for ( I don't even know if he will agree to my requirement ) I should definitely ask for it since I myself will be in the same boat ( require consent from neighbors ) a few years later. Please communicate your suggestions and comments on this matter. Thank you",

No undertaking or an agreement based on any unforeseen future contingent will be maintainable nor it will be enforceable in law. The neighbor can refuse to give any such undertaking as you desire, hence do not take any such decision, just drop such ideas.",
            "Dear Client, To relieve your apprehensions with the construction plans of your neighbours in Gurugram you should ask him to furnish a written commitment that he will not encroach the basement nearer that 2 feet from your property in order to preserve the stability of the structure of your property. Also, you can get a guarantee for the future construction consent and also provide a clause where any future owners pledge to this agreement. This may improve the concept of the enforcement of the undertaking. In the Haryana Building Code, developers are often expected to obtain No Objection Certificates from their neighbours, hence such agreements should be reduced into writing. As much as courtesy goes in any neighbourly relation, getting these commitments may save your net as you prepare for future constructions. The best thing that could be done when preparing such documents is to seek the service of a legal attorney. Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.",

            "Dear Client, Here is the possible response to your queries Under the Hindu Succession Act, when a Hindu male dies intestate, then his property is divided equally among his Class I legal heirs which in your case are you, your mother and sister. You are, therefore, entitled to a one-third share in both the houses, regardless of whether your mother or sister are staying in one of them. In case you let go of the property to your mother, you will surrender your claim; therefore, it would not be easy raising your stake after some time. Technically, the law would have given her full ownership of the property. The property would otherwise be divided equally among the three of you. After having received her one third, your mother is free to gift or transfer her share to your sister, but this does not affect your right to your one third. Correspondingly, regarding your father's Provident Fund (PF), you are at par with a share in that amount as a Class I heir. If the PF has already been claimed by your mother and sister, you can demand to know the details of the amounts and take legal recourse to stake your claims if necessary. If they are trying to sell their holdings and are asking you to transfer your share to your mother, you should not do that without ensuring first that you are adequately compensated for your share or otherwise protected. A consultation with a lawyer would make sure your interests were looked after in all eventualities of transfer or sale agreements. Thank you.Hope this answers your query."

He however paid 300,000/- ( advance). A receipt was issued to him against the advance payment. In the receipt it is clearly mentioned it's an advance and part payment. I sent him multiple reminders to perform the contract and deposit the balance amount. He defaulted to perform the contract. He did not sign the rent agreement nor paid the balance amount. I sent him a legal notice to perform the contract as the property remained block for 3 months causing me losses. He filed a criminal case against me under section 420 which was quashed by the HC. After a few months of filing the criminal case he filed another case against me. It was a civil suit. In the plaint he seeks the following: \"decree of declaration in favour of plaintiff and against the defendant whereby the plaintiff be declared as lessee of the suit property\" .A decree of permanent injunction and not to create 3rd party right.

        "answers": [
            "Dear Client, I would like to inform you that, In your situation, a request to declare the plaintiff as a tenant without a rental agreement or occupation cannot be considered. In order for a lease agreement to be legitimate, it must include mutual agreement, complete rent payment, and possession, all of which are absent in this particular situation. If a rental contract was not signed and the plaintiff did not meet their responsibilities, they have no grounds to assert tenancy. Part performance by the transferee is necessary for Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act (doctrine of part performance) to be applicable. The plaintiff is not eligible for protection under this section since he did not fulfill his obligations in the contract. A true owner is typically not allowed to be subjected to an injunction. You can challenge the plaintiff's effort to prevent you from managing your own property with an ex-parte order. You can find support from the ruling of the Supreme Court in Karnataka Board of Wakf v. Government of India (2004) 10 SCC 779, which affirmed that a tenant or claimant without legal possession or agreement cannot seek injunction against the rightful owner. An unmarked complaint is also not considered legitimate according to Order VI Rule 14 of the CPC, 1908, which requires pleadings to be signed by the party or their authorized agent. Additionally, it should also be raised during arguments as it questions the validity. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",

Moreover he paid a partial amount towards the agreed advance amount hence it cannot be concluded that he had paid the advance or security amount towards leasing the property.

            "Dear Client, I understand your concern regarding the blocking of INR 15,000 from your bank account due to a cyber complaint. Based on the information provided, I will provide an expert legal response to address your query. Under Indian law, banks are required to comply with the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines on cybersecurity. If a bank receives a cyber complaint or suspects any unauthorized or fraudulent activity related to a customer's account, it has the authority to temporarily block or freeze the account as a precautionary measure. The blocking of funds in your account could be due to the following reasons: 1. Suspected Unauthorized Transaction: If the bank suspects that your account has been compromised or used for unauthorized transactions, it may block the funds as a security measure to prevent further misuse. 2. Cybercrime Investigation: If a cybercrime complaint has been filed against you or your account, the bank may have received a request from law enforcement agencies to block the funds temporarily for investigation purposes. 3. Compliance with Regulatory Requirements: Banks are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, including those related to anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT). If any suspicious activity is detected, the bank may block the funds as a precautionary measure. Regarding the lack of communication from the cybercrime authorities or the police station, it is possible that the investigation is still ongoing, and they may contact you at a later stage if required. Here are some steps you can take: 1. Obtain a Written Explanation: Request a written explanation from the bank regarding the specific reasons for blocking your funds and the nature of the cyber complaint. This will help you understand the situation better and take appropriate action. 2. Provide Necessary Information: If the bank requests any additional information or documentation from you, promptly provide the same to facilitate the resolution of the issue. 3. Seek Legal Assistance: If the issue persists or if you believe that the bank's actions are unjustified, you may consider seeking legal assistance from a competent lawyer specializing in banking and cybercrime laws. 4. File a Complaint: If the bank fails to provide a satisfactory explanation or resolution, you can file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman or the Cyber Crime Cell of your local police station, depending on the nature of the issue. It is important to note that banks are required to follow due process and provide reasonable justification for blocking funds. If it is indeed a mistake on their part, they should rectify the situation promptly. I hope this expert legal response helps you understand the situation better and guides you on the appropriate course of action. If you require any further assistance or have additional queries, please feel free to reach out. Regards, Adv Arunkumar Khedia Bombay Highcourt",
            "Police would conduct investigations and if no fraud has been committed by you then your bank account will be unfrozen",
            "From your statement it seems the complaint has been lodged against your account number where money might have been credited from unknown accounts without their knowledge. I suggest you to check with your local ps and bank manager with this. Regards"

I am a plaintiff in a case of permanent injunction restraining the defendants from interfering in our peaceful possession . The said property was gifted by mother to me and my brother in 2012.

The said property was formed & obtained after permission of Government in 1937. 100% genuinely formed property. When I filed the case of permanent injunction not to interfere in our peaceful possession the defendants just filed a vakalath and did not attend the case . Now it is for plaintiff evidence stage. Instead of appearing for this case they have filed a false counter case against my mother and me and my brother. They have narrated that it is ancestral property and my mother has obtained falsely. We have filed written statement. Both the cases are pending in the same court hall. Can two cases be filed against the same subject matter? Principle law of justice? Refer case law ?

Since your suit is on permanent injunction restraining interference, whereas the counter claim by defendants involves an averment that the property is an ancestral one, if they give rise to different questions of law each may be allowed to proceed with the court dealing with each case on their respective merits. With regard to the contention of the defendants that the property is an ancestral one, a registered sale deed as in the case of acquisition made by your grandfather in the year 1944 would certainly break the chain. This would mean your mother bought the property as self-acquired, not ancestral. A father can sell property to his daughter by way of executing a sale deed, if it is his self-acquired property, and the rules are stipulated under Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. It has been held in a series of judgments by the courts that once the property is acquired by purchase, it cannot be termed as ancestral property (See S. Sai Reddy v. S. Narayana Reddy, AIR 1991 SC 2086). You could represent yourself under Order III Rule 1 of the CPC, whereby parties are allowed to represent themselves. To adequately represent, ensure you have all documentary evidence, be it a sale deed, and prepare to argue on facts and legal principles, more so on the point of whether the property is ancestral or self-acquired. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",

He can very well plead that she was forced by her parents into this marriage against her willingness, she is not cooperating with him for a happy married life and refuses to offer conjugal relationship and due to this their marriage was not consummated. Thus he suffered mental agony and was to a state of depression hence he has filed the divorce case on the grounds of mental cruelty. You can suggest him accordingly.",
            "Hi, You can issue legal notice to your brother's wife and their parents for amicable and mutual divorce petition. If she agrees then MOU / Settlement Agreement can be drawn and executed and based on that Divorce petition can be filed. Regards, Niteish Agarwal",
            "Dear Client, In the case you have described, the wife's rejection to consummate her marriage and her statement that she was married against her will by her parents can be grounds for an annulment. According to Section 12(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, a marriage is annulled when it has not been consummated with the intention or willful refusal of the other spouse. Moreover, if she had a marriage sullenly induced against her will, that too might be a ground for annulment under Section 12(1)(c) because of a lack of free consent. To get this marriage annulled, your brother has to file a petition in the family court and present proof that it hasn't been consummated with her and has no intention of fulfilling marital duties. Whatever be the case, her parents' silence is immaterial to the case, since the case involves only the couple. The court will study circumstances and determine if the marriage can be declared voidable. Since this marriage isn't consummated, there's more chances of a successful annulment petition. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",
            "Dear Sir, Annulment normally will have to be filed within one year of Marriage. Anyhow such ground can be taken and also the ground of non consummation of marriage, desertion and cruelty grounds maybe taken to get divorce without alimony."

        "full_text": "Filing complaint against ex husband after 15 years of divorce. Hi I had been in a marriage for 7 years with a terrible emotional, sexual and verbal abuse that left me with a lifetime severe illness. I was very young, I filed a mutual consent divorce with no material claim and moved out of the marriage. With time I realised my ex husband is a potential threat to many women and he has done very wrong with many women so far. It's not like waking up from sleep and trying to implicate a person, but I realised me not reporting him allowed him to continue this pattern. He's a psychopath and a Sociopath.",
