            "In Kerala, the legal heirs of a deceased male Christian, if he died intestate (without a will), are determined by the Indian Succession Act, 1925, and the primary legal heirs include the widow, children (sons and daughters), and in the absence of these, parents, siblings, and other relatives. Since you are the primary legal heir, you don't require the NOC from his mother or other extended relatives. The spouse is considered the sole legal heir in this scenario. The Indian Succession Act, 1925 governs the distribution of property in such case. If the Tahsildar is delaying the issuance of certificate without any valid reason, you may approach District collector with an application seeking direction to the Tahsildar in this regard and his intervention.",
            "As the husband was a government employee, all his official records would reveal the wife's details. Why do they insist on a legal heir certificate for giving her a job on compassionate basis? The legal heirs certificate issued by the tehsildar should list out all the legal heirs of the deceased in accordance with their personal law (in this case, Christian). If the tehsildar is not helpful, the wife can complain to the next Revenue authorities, including the District Collector.",
            "On demise of husband wife and mother are the legal heirs 2) no objection certificate is necessary for obtaining legal heir certificate in wife name only",
            "Wife is first legal heir to husband, not brother or mother. Even if Tahasildar rejects to issue legal heir certificate to wife, she is entitled to job on compassionate ground. Against delay by Tahasildar you approach Deputy Collector."

        "full_text": "Joint property dispute. So me and my husband jointly purchased a property sometime back. Registered deep is solely on our name but some cash payment was done by my husband's parents without any agreement. Also his brother has sent some money to my husband's account as assistance in the purchase but there was no agreement signed between them. Now we are having some disputes with the in laws and we are afraid they might try to claim the share in our property. My questions are Can his brother based on the amount he transferred to my husband's account claim the share in our property although there was no agreement ? Can his parents claim the share in our property based on the cash transactions which has no record and can not be proven at all ( no bank withdrawals either ) Right now we both have 50% each share in the property, but if my husband transfers his 50% to my name (wife's name ) can we make our house claim free from my in laws ? Since the house is owned by us, can we evict my brother in law from the house ? Please guide just on the basis of law. Note - All the transactions on record are made from our own accounts.",
        "answers": [
            "Brother can claim share in property 2) parents cannot claim as there is no proof of payment made by them 3) husband can execute gift deed in your favour 4) if you evict brother in law he will claim share in property 5) return money advanced by BIL",
            "Your brother in law can demand return of the amount he lent to you at the time of purchase based on the documentary evidence for the amount lent. Your parents in law also can demand the return of the amount given to you at the time of purchase of the property based on the documentary evidence they possess. Your husband has to transfer his share in the property by executing a registered gift or release deed in your favor after which you will become an absolute owner of the entire property, in that event also your husband's extended relatives can claim their amount given from your husband. Yes, you can issue a legal notice instructing him to vacate the house and deliver vacant possession failing which you can file a suit for ejectment to eject him from your house mentioning that he is an unauthorised occupier in the house.",
            "1. Once the property is purchased in your name and deed is registered , it can not be claimed by any other person even if monetary contributions is made by them. 2. So your husband need not transfer his half share in your name. That would not cause any change in the situation. 3. However to evade any dispute it is better not to evict your own family members from the house.",

Land owner had a registered sale agreement with the purchaser Sale consideration was 2 crore 60 lakhs Cheques given for 2 crore 45 lakhs ( 80 lakhs cheque not cashed) Terms were 1. If any post dated check gets dishonoured, the purchaser should come into an agreement to settle money within 15 days If the above condition is not met the sale agreement stands canceled and land owner can sell the land to any other 3rd party 2. There’s NO TIME LIMIT to execute sale deed as almost entire sale consideration has been paid, the purchaser can register any time. Agreement happened on 24/10/2010 Till this date 1 crore cheques was encased Land owner died on 09/11/2010 Till this date Total 1 crore 60 lakhs cheque was encashed After owner death, the family asked purchaser to provide new cheque on legal heir name But they didn’t Legal heirs became new land owner after the fathers death Also the purchaser went absconding as he was caught under PACL land scam Land owner send legal notice to agreement holder to finish the agreement, But he never responded After waiting for 10 years In 2021 land owner entered into joint agreement, converted land to site and sold all the sites The land Is DC converted Now land owner has built 1 house and many site owners have constructed houses. There are around 20 houses in the 45 site layout In 2023 the land owner filed a case in court to cancel the 2010 agreement based on the above mentioned clause 1 2 years have passed and the agreement holder hasn’t appeared in the court Seems like an ex party judgment can happen. My question is Is it safe to purchase site and build a house over there? What will be risk scenario? How many percent risk is there? Few lawyers told risk is 15% and ex party judgment will happen in 1 year If the ex party judgement doesn’t happen and I build a house, what are the consequences? Can the agreement holder win the case? If he wins and I have constructed house, will it affect my possession? Will the house get demolished? Or will it just be a compensation settlement?",
        "answers": [
            "It is not safe to purchase the proposed property because a litigation is pending before court in this regard, once the case filed by the land owner is disposed and if the judgment is in his favor then after the expiry of the period to prefer appeal, you can obtain a legal opinion from an experienced lawyer to proceed with the proposed purchase. You must note tht the agreement holder has given a substantial amount towards purchase of the property hence the risk is that in caase he turns up then the court may pas a verdict in his favor too because it is not barred by limitation as the land owner himself has re-activated the expired agreement by approaching the court hence the agreement gets a new period of limitation from the date of filing the suit by the landowner",
            "There is no such per centage of success in litigation. A claim can succeed or fail. In your case any claim by agreement holder is bound to fail. The agreement was executed ten years back, no Court will admit any such time barred claim. The buyer cannot even get his advance refunded. Property changed hands and constructions came up. Law cannot reverse the time.",

A cancellation suit is already filed and pending since 2023. Risk Level: Moderate to Low (~15%), since: The buyer breached contract terms. Legal heirs waited over 10 years before reselling. Buyer has not appeared in court for 2 years — likely to result in ex parte cancellation. If Ex Parte Judgment Delays: You can still build, but there's legal uncertainty until court decides. Worst-Case Scenario: If original buyer suddenly appears and wins (very unlikely), he may claim ownership. This could lead to: Compensation demand (most likely). Possession challenge (rare, and hard to win after 13+ years delay). House demolition: Very unlikely, only happens in illegal construction cases. ✅ Recommendation: Proceed only after checking: Latest court status. Whether land is mutation and title-cleared in current seller's name. Legal opinion in writing from a property lawyer. You may also request an indemnity clause from seller for extra protection.",

        "full_text": "Builder acquiring majority units in a Delhi builder-floor: legal options for dissenting owners (dos) to safeguard rights against. We are facing a legal situation involving a 30+ year-old builder-floor property in Delhi comprising 8 independent flats. The property lacks a sanctioned building plan, Occupation Certificate (OC), and Completion Certificate (CC), though each flat is registered independently in the names of different owners. Recently, a builder/developer has entered the picture and started acquiring units. As of now: 5 out of 8 flats have been acquired by the builder or his associates (over 62.5% ownership). 1 more Dissenting Owner (DO) is currently in talks and may sell soon. Only 2 DOs are holding out, refusing the current offer citing extremely low compensation, lack of transparency, and undervaluation. The builder is aggressively pursuing acquisition with the intent of demolishing and redeveloping the property. The remaining DOs are concerned that if the builder reaches 6 or more units, he might move to: File for partition in court. Request an auction of the entire property. Try to undervalue the property to secure it cheaply in a court-led auction process. Coerce or harass remaining DOs into surrendering rights through pressure tactics. We need expert legal input on the following: 1. Builder’s Possible Legal Routes (As being threatened by him): What legal remedies can the builder now invoke to force acquisition or possession of the remaining units? Can he approach the court for a partition and force a sale through public or court-supervised auction? Can the builder request the court to appoint a valuer and push for undervaluation or collude to get a lower reserve price? 2. Risks of Valuation Manipulation: How common or legally permissible is undervaluation or manipulation of base prices in partition auction cases? Are there known Delhi cases where builders acquired property through partition suits and undervalued auctions? 3. Legal Remedies & Strategies for DOs: What immediate legal steps can DOs take to prevent undervaluation or coercion? (e.g., caveats, RTIs, legal notices, objections) How can DOs demand High Court oversight or fair valuation mechanisms? What is the realistic probability of: Securing a stay on any unfair auction or partition sale? Getting the auction supervised by the High Court? Challenging and halting redevelopment until fair terms are negotiated? 4. Long-term Outcomes and Legal Cost: What are the long-term outcomes DOs can realistically expect if they do not consent to current offers? What are the approximate timelines and legal expenses from lower court to High Court or Supreme Court if the matter escalates? Is there a practical way DOs can secure higher compensation or better terms if they resist? Kindly advise on the best course of action and share any precedents or practical examples that may help us.",

            "You're dealing with a common yet complex issue in Delhi involving builder-floor redevelopments where a builder acquires majority units (5 of 8, possibly 6 soon) and pressures remaining dissenting owners (DOs) into selling. Legally, if the builder claims the property as undivided (due to no OC, CC, or sanctioned plan), he may file a partition suit and seek a court-ordered auction. In such cases, there’s a real risk of undervaluation, especially if the builder influences the valuation process. This has happened in past Delhi cases, where court-supervised sales favored builders due to low reserve prices. To protect your interests, DOs should immediately file caveats in local and High Court, issue a legal notice asserting ownership rights, and file RTIs with MCD/DDA regarding building legality. If partition or auction is initiated, demand a court-appointed independent valuer and request High Court supervision for transparency. Filing a writ petition under Article 226 is a strong option if there's coercion or procedural unfairness. While litigation may stretch 5–10 years with costs ranging ₹5–30 lakhs, resisting can lead to higher compensation or better redevelopment terms. Joint legal action by DOs improves your position significantly.",
            "1. The builder may move court for partition since the building has no OC or CC besides there are two dissenting owners for redevelopment. In that case the DOs would be made as parties to the suit, they can then challenge the suit filed by him on merits and can oppose the valuer or commissioner recommended by the builder, instead they can request the court to appoint independent valuer or a commissioner. 2. Any person who intends to grasp the properties by any illegal means can adopt any type of strategy including the under valuation of the property therefore it is not an uncommon situation. you need to exercise cautionary measures accordingly. 3. A builder cannot unilaterally demand a partition of independent flats solely based on owning a majority share, as each flat owner has a right to their property and a proportionate share in the land. This UDS ensures that apartment owners are the legal holders of the land, providing rights in common spaces, and the overall property. Partitioning a property involves dividing it into separate, independent units. While a builder may have a majority share, they cannot unilaterally force a partition or redevelopment of independent flats without the consent of all the flat owners. 4. Insofar as the time taken for disposal of the case by lower courts till supreme court, is an enigmatic situation, nobody can predict the time taken at different levels or each level owing to various factors involved in the court cases across India. In cases of disputes or redevelopment, the UDS ownership is vital, as it helps in asserting claims. The builder therefore cannot bring the properties into a partition suit, because it is not maintainable as the properties / flats are already partitioned into individual units",
            "It’s better to first get the feasibility report of the said plan and what is the potential which is likely to be received by the members for the said project. Whether builder is getting all the permissions for the said project before your vacation. If there is a discrepancy then approach Hc in writ petition for the same",
            "As each apartment is owned independently, build is helpless unless he acquires ownership of title through a proper transfer by execution of sale deed. Even one owner by refusing to sale his apartment can prevent builder from proceedings with possession of all complex. It is matter of determination of individual apartment owners that will force builder to settle the matter on terms of apartment owners/Dos. Hold your ground, he will come on knees."

        "full_text": "Can a contempt petition be refiled. I had filed a civil contempt petition against RBI. The matter pertained to certain unilateral post judgement alterations made by RBI in it's circular dt [deleted] to its regulated entities pursuant to the directions issued by the Hon'ble SC on WPC 476/2020. In WPC 476/2020, the Honble SC directed that no interest on interest shall be charged from eligible borrowers who defaulted during the moratorium \"for the period during the moratorium\". However, RBI who was a party to the case altered the judgement directions and issued a circular dt [deleted] mentioning that the honble SC had issued directions that no interest on interest will be charged from borrowers during the moratorium period. On this basis Regulated entities reversed the capitalization during the moratorium but continued to charge for the moratorium from 1st September 2020 onwards although the Honble SC had barred the charge of Interest on interest both for & during the moratorium. My contempt petition 34743/2024 against RBI was heard on 4.4.25 where the learned judges asked me if i was a party to the original WPC 476/2020. When i replied no, they asked me how i was filing the contempt petition. I quoted the judgement in a contempt petition filed in RBI vs Jayanti lal mistry case where it washeld that in terms of general directions, any aggreived person can file a contempt petition and the jurisdiction is not limited to only the parties to the case. The learned judges did not pursue this legal precedent further nor ask me to show the case judgement. They simply went on to ask me if I would like to withdraw my case or if they should put exemplary cost and dismiss it. Given the situation, I was forced to withdraw my case. Now, the order says it is dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to avail applicable remedy under law. They have not specifically mentioned that I have liberty to refile the contempt case. In this scenario, can I 1. Refile my contempt case quoting additional submissions & grounds for refiling explaining why I am eligible to file a contempt petition in view of Girish Mittal Vs Parvati sundaram case page 11&12. 2. If not can I refile the contempt petition with a co petitioner who was a original party to the case. 3. What are the procedural formalities to do it, Do i need to file a SLP seeking permission to refile? 4. Is there a possibility that the court having dismissed the contempt petition as withdrawn will not entertain the contempt petition again now even though the petitioner is now showing evidence of legal precedents which answer the courts concern regarding locus standing of the petitioner affecting maintainability?",
        "answers": [
            "Yes, since your petition was dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to seek remedy under law, you can refile it with better legal backing. Refile with additional grounds – You can include new legal precedents like Girish Mittal vs Parvati Sundaram which supports your right to file contempt even if not a party to the original case. Refile with a co-petitioner – If you include someone who was a party to WPC 476/2020, it strengthens the case and directly addresses the court's concern about locus standi. No SLP needed – Since the case wasn’t dismissed on merits, you don’t need a Special Leave Petition to refile. Court can entertain it again – Courts generally allow refiling in such cases, especially when new facts or precedents are presented and the earlier petition was not decided on merits. Let me know if you'd like help drafting the revised petition or summarizing key judgments.",
            "Firstly before filing the contempt petition agaisnt the RBI, you should have exhausted the remedies before RBI. if the RBI had dismissed or not entertained your request for exempting the interest against interest during moratorium period despite you providing the sC precedent directing the bank to not to charge interest on the interest over the borrowed amount for the period during moratorium then you could have approached supreme court with the proposed contempt petition. Even now you should first exhaust the remedy with the RBI and then file the contempt petition if there is no proper response from RBI",
            "The contempt petition should be filed by petitioner who was party to the original case 2) you should not file contempt petition as it would not be entertained",
            "SC judgments have binding value .court ought to have considered the prudente cited by you 2) if court does not find nay substance in your submissions it can ask you to with draw or impose costs",
            "Your contention is, submissions in support of you case was not heard by the Court and now you again want to appear and argue you case. You are not refiling contempt, you are seeking review of earlier order. There is no such refiling of contempt, fresh contempt can be filed if there fresh contempt is committed. Given the facts—warning of costs—any refiling will be viewed adversely by the Court."

        "answers": [
            "Thanks for sharing these important details. From what you've explained, your matter involves a mix of property law under Section 118 of the Himachal Pradesh Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, tenancy issues, and a pending criminal complaint—all of which require strategic legal handling to protect your rights and close this issue permanently. Let me guide you point-by-point: As per Section 118, non-agriculturists require permission to purchase or lease land in Himachal Pradesh. Since you’ve already obtained government permission to purchase the land, your ownership is valid. However, creating a lease deed with a non-agriculturist without proper government permission may technically be seen as a violation only if: It is a long-term lease that amounts to transfer of possession/control, It is considered a disguised sale or permanent arrangement, And if there is irrefutable proof that a formal lease was executed and acted upon. Your defence here will rely on: The nature of the agreement (short-term, non-renewable, no possession rights, and conditional use only after registration), The fact that you initiated registration and NOC was granted by police in 3 months, And that the agreement has no evidentiary strength, as it’s not in his possession, it was partly oral, and was not registered or legally enforceable under the Act. So yes—you can challenge the validity of the lease agreement, or state that it was a conditional licence, not a lease, and certainly not in the nature of transfer contemplated under Section 118. Since: The FIR is pending but chargesheet has not been filed for 7 months, You have a NOC from police themselves to operate the homestay, His possession was conditional and terminated due to breach, You have a strong case that there was no illegal trespass. Police delay in filing the chargesheet may also work in your favour as lack of prima facie evidence. We can even consider moving to quash the FIR under Section 482 CrPC if needed—after reviewing the contents of the complaint. This is just pressure tactics. Now that your homestay is registered, you are legally compliant. I can help you draft a proper reply to the Tehsildar explaining: That there was no valid lease or transfer, That the agreement was not acted upon legally or completed, And that the complainant is trying to harass you after being evicted for suspicious activity. We’ll also highlight the NOC and registration of the homestay to show bona fide compliance. You’re at a stage where everything needs to be consolidated with legally strong, clear replies—before things go against you in record. Based on what you've told me, I can assist you with: Drafting a professional legal reply to the Tehsildar under Section 118, Strategic advice on handling the police FIR and possibly getting it quashed, Drafting a reply to the tourism department to close that complaint, and Preparing future-proof documentation for your homestay to avoid such issues again. Let me handle this properly for you—you’ve already taken all the right steps like getting NOC and registration, now let’s put it all together legally and professionally. Warm regards Contact/WhatsApp No-",
            "It is necessary to peruse notice received by you to advice take the plea that you have not entered into registered lease deed 3) you had entered into notarised agreement but it was never acted upon as full payment was not received by you 4) you are running home stay on the premises and are in possession of the property",
            "Property purchased with proper 118 permission. Lease was unregistered for 11 months, now cancelled. Tenant violated terms, didn’t pay full amount – evicted within 4 months. Police gave NOC; homestay now registered and compliant. Agreement invalid – no stamp paper, signed by wife, not principal party. No intention to violate law; issue now resolved. Request to close matter as there was no malafide intent.",
            "To challenge a complaint alleging violation of Section 118 of the Himachal Pradesh Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, you need to understand the specific provisions of the law and how it applies to your situation. You can then prepare a legal response by gathering relevant evidence. Section 118 generally prohibits the transfer of land in Himachal Pradesh to non-agriculturists without prior permission from the government. Based on your evidence, you can prepare a written response to the complaint, addressing the allegations and presenting your case. As per the provision of section 118 of H.P. Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, 1972 the land purchased by a non-agriculturist after obtaining the permission of Government is required to be put to use within stipulated period for the purpose for which permission was granted. Therefore you may gather evidence to establish the fact that there was no violation in this regard and challenge the same appropriately before the concerned authorities.",
            "Bar under Section 118 is not applicable to transfer by way of lease of land or building in a municipal area. If the land is in municipal are you are not liable for any penalty under revenue Act."

However, the ultimate sale deed must be executed and registered within a reasonable time, which is generally considered to be within that 3-year period. The limitation period for filing a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell, as per Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 1963, is three years from the date fixed for performance, or if no date is fixed, from when the plaintiff has notice of the refusal to perform. In your case neither the buyer issued any notice to the vendor before the expiry of the time limit expressing his readiness and willingness to buy the property by paying the balance of sale consideration amount. Thus as per law the buyer cannot enforce the registration of sale deed beyond the period of three years. Besides, the property has been developed into a plotted layout and the entire plot have been sold out over the period from the date of development of layout till this date, besides plenty of buyers have even constructed houses in the purchased plots, therefore there is no possibilities for the buyer to turn up at this stage claiming registration of property as per sale agreement and even if he is filing any case, it will not be entertained by court because the buyer was not given possession too at that time. you may proceed with the proposed purchase of property but as a precaution you may obtain a proper legal opinion from an experienced lawyer in the local and proceed only if recommended",

I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding marriage fraud, financial neglect, and emotional abandonment committed by my husband, who resides in The Colony, Texas and is currently employed at JP Morgan Chase, Plano on an H-1B visa. I entered the U.S. on an H-4 visa on 8th February 2023 after leaving my stable job at KPMG at Gurgaon, India, based on my husband's repeated assurances that he would support my education and career while awaiting his I-140 approval. However, after I made this life-altering decision, he failed to fulfill his promises, abandoned me emotionally and financially and possibly committed fraud for tax benefits. Key Issues: 1. Marital Abandonment & No Communication I had a confirmed return ticket to the U.S. for April 14, 2024, but my husband and his family asked me not to return, without any legal separation or divorce proceedings. He has not made any efforts to communicate or attend marriage counseling despite repeated requests, leaving me in limbo. His actions amount to spousal neglect and abandonment, as I am struggling alone in India, with no clarity on my future or legal rights. 2. Financial Neglect & Sudden Restriction of Access I am still listed on our lease agreement in The Colony, Texas, yet he has not provided any financial support since I left for India. Upon confronting him about a strip club transaction, he immediately changed his Chase bank app password, restricted my access to financial resources, and stopped responding. He previously contributed ₹18,000 INR per month toward my wedding loan EMIs, but stopped payments without discussion after March 7, 2024. I had to take a lower-paying job in Gurgaon due to this situation, significantly impacting my financial stability. 3. Potential Marriage Fraud for Tax Benefits He only communicated properly for one week when he needed my signature for tax filing and then cut off all contact again. He asked me whether to file jointly or separately, suggesting he was strategizing to maximize his tax refund, yet he never informed me of his final decision. His behavior raises serious concerns about whether he married me to benefit from tax refunds and later abandoned me. 4. Substance Abuse & Emotional Distress I was forced to leave the U.S. because of his excessive alcohol and drug use, which was damaging our marriage. On December 31, 2023, during an argument over his drinking, he threatened self-harm, causing severe emotional distress. His substance abuse continues unchecked, and he has made no effort to seek help. 5. Infidelity & Deceptive Behavior When I called for a counseling discussion, I heard a woman’s voice in the background, after which he immediately disconnected and has not contacted me since. On March 28th Friday(usa), I found transactions from a strip club, confirming my suspicions of infidelity. His sister tried to justify his actions instead of acknowledging his deception.",

Also the Association did not want to register with GST as it is complex decided to raise the Maintenace as two invoices. The monthly Invoice was kept to 7499/- per month and end of the QTR they have raised a Invoice as Differential amount for the QTR that is a whopping 18 K for the QTR. I need your advice on what is the best option for me to seek legal help for Equal Maintenace?",

            "Is your association registered under provisions of cooperative societies act 2) what are provisions of bye laws adopted by society 3) maintenance would be as per provisions of bye laws adopted by association 4) generally it should be equal irrespective of size of villa 5) property taxes ,insurance ,water charges would be as per area of villa",

Therefore, apparently there is no anomaly in the procedure adopted by the association in raising the Bills. If you inform the illegalities they are adopting then further advice can be given",
            "- The calculation of the maintenance charges varies from society to society and not fixed rule. - As per the Supreme Court , Society Maintenance charges have provisioned rules to safeguard the rights of homeowners. - However, RWA has no legal authority, to issue moral, ethical and social diktats to its residents. - Further, Society by law and resolutions must be limited to the mandate of governing the society’s affairs and nothing more. - Hence, you can lodge your complaint before the management of the society on the ground of earlier paid equal maintenance charges - If refused then you can file a complaint before the Registrar.",
            "The bylaws of the association is to be perused for knowing the law and decision of association in this regard. If the bylaws were ammended by a resolution supported by majority members then the bylaws is applicable to all the members and no one can claim exemption. Even if you approach the registrar of cooperative society you may not get any relief."

I lost my mom to death around 1.11 years ago, according to me it was a medical negligence, I do not have any another testimony from the doctors, but there were negligences like 1. Questionable Billing Practices – A sudden, unsolicited 50% bill discount suggests an attempt to cover up negligence and prevent legal action. 2. Systemic Negligence & Loss of Trust – Multiple lapses, including misidentifying patients and withholding information, demonstrate a fundamental disregard for patient safety. 3. Unwarranted Urgency & Misleading Reassurances – Dr. falsely insisted on immediate surgery due to his travel plans and downplayed risks, misleading us into consent. 4. Failure to Obtain Informed Consent – Critical risks were withheld, and my mother was only informed at the last minute, causing panic that directly contributed to her death. 5. Lack of Proper Risk Disclosure – The procedure’s risks were misrepresented, preventing us from making an informed decision, rendering consent invalid. 4. Patient Identification Errors – My mother’s vitals were displayed under another patient’s name, raising serious concerns about monitoring accuracy and patient safety. 5. Lack of Pre-Operative Readiness Assessment – No proof was provided that necessary tests were conducted to determine my mother’s suitability for surgery. 6. Unexplained Deterioration Post-Surgery – She was stable before surgery but immediately placed on a ventilator and lapsed into a coma, with no clear explanation provided. 7. Inadequate Critical Care Facilities – Despite assurances, she was placed in ICU instead of ICCU, revealing a lack of proper infrastructure and negligence. 8. Surgeon’s Absence & Patient Abandonment – Dr. left for his flight post-surgery without informing us, leaving my critically ill mother under the care of others. 9. Unexplained Delay in Releasing the Body – The hospital delayed releasing my mother’s body for five hours without justification. 10. Evasion of Post-Operative Explanation – Dr. promised to explain later but avoided accountability when questioned a month after her passing. Also I am not seeking any kind of compensation at all here I wasn’t given a through understanding of what exactly happened to her in OT, please suggest will these above mentioned points are enough for me to file the case against the doctor or I need mandatorily a testimony stating what exactly was the medical negligence, also it’s going to be 2 years in sometime- will the timeline affect my case(my family was mentally unstable to create this compliant)",
        "answers": [
            "You need the medical diagnostic reports to assess the treatment provided and identify any deviations from the standard of care. 2) you would need Expert medical opinions to establish the standard of care and whether the healthcare provider's actions deviated from it 3) you can approach the State Medical Council for accountability if you are seeking disciplinary action against the doctors and hospital",

It is difficult of predict what shape it will take after birth. File a properly drafted complaint in District Consumer Commission with all documentary evidence, experts can be obtained down the line as and when necessary. Even a testimony of foreign expert is admissible. You are within limitation. A complaint can be filed even one day before limitation date.",
            "Yes, medical testimony is highly recommended but not always mandatory. Courts rely on expert opinions to establish whether the doctor deviated from standard medical practices. Without a medical expert, proving negligence becomes challenging, but not impossible. Your allegations (billing discrepancies, lack of informed consent, improper care, patient misidentification, and unexplained deterioration) raise serious concerns. However, to prove negligence legally, you need: Medical Records – Obtain and review all records from the hospital. Independent Expert Opinion – A neutral doctor can analyze the case. Hospital Guidelines & Standard Practices – Compare actions against medical protocols. Eyewitness Testimonies – Statements from nurses, hospital staff, or other patients’ families. Medical negligence cases in Consumer Court: 2 years from the date of incident. Exception: If you were mentally unfit to file earlier, courts may allow a delay. Criminal Negligence (IPC 304A): Generally within 3 years, but earlier is better. Consult a Medical Expert to strengthen your case. File a Complaint in Consumer Court before the 2-year limit expires. Consider a Criminal Case (IPC 304A) if gross negligence is evident. Would you like help drafting a legal complaint?",

We had bought a plot together in Bangalore (upfront payment and no loans) in which I was the sole contributor 2 years before the divorce. Hence we put both our names in the Sale Deed registered at the SRO. Now that I want to have her name removed from the title, my questions are: 1. Does the Divorce Decree suffice to get her name removed from the property as its already mentioned in the Decree (along with the plot details and registeration number) that she would not claim it and does not have any interest in the property. 2. If Divorce Decree is not sufficient, what is the process in details to get her name removed from the title? What would be the overall charges (Stamp Duty and anything else). Also will she be required to be present in-person for this process? 3. If she is required to be present in-peson but is not able to travel to India for the relinquishment deed, can she give a power of attorney to someone in India who is not a blood relative and what is the process of getting a Power of Attorney for NRI as she is outside India?

Request the court to declare the land as joint family property and seek partition. Gather bank records, cheque details, and any proof showing that the land was purchased using your father’s money. Any family records or written communication acknowledging your share will strengthen the case. If you can prove your father paid for the land and it was held in trust for the family, you can challenge your brother’s sole ownership under the Benami law.

            "As the property was purchased by your father on your brother's name, it becomes your brother's property hence any claim towards any share in the property made by you may not be tenable in law. However if the property was purchased using ancestral funds (money inherited from previous generations), you may have a claim to a share, even if the property is in your brother's name. If the property was purchased using your father's self-earned money, it is considered his self-acquired property, and he can legally transfer it to anyone, including your brother, without your consent. You have not stated whether your father is living or not, if your father is living then you cannot claim any share in the property as right for any reason. If your father had a will and it specifies the distribution of his property, the will will determine who inherits what. If you can prove that your father used ancestral funds to purchase the property, you may have a stronger case for a share, even if the property is in your brother's name. You may need to provide evidence such as bank statements, transaction records, or other documentation that demonstrates your father's financial contribution. You cannot legally get a share of the property if it is registered in your brothers name. The law will consider that the property is owned by your brother."

Things were good for the first few weeks. But then he started to criticize my clothes, my choice of bags, even my opinions and how I spoke. I tried to talk to him calmly a few times how his comments were hurtful but he never thought he was wrong. Even a normal conflict of interest started to become a huge fight and I was labelled as too sensitive, too emotional etc. His mother also interfered a lot even when away and constantly insulted me because of my skin color, my clothes, my jokes, my way of speaking. During conflicts, I got emotional and cried and my husband would walk away. Zero empathy. In anger, I used to shut the door loudly and hit the mattress in anger. I have never harmed myself or him or anyone else. But his and his mom's toxic behavior continued and my reactions were the problem always, never their words. Living separately since Jan 31st, 2025 because he said so. I waited for almost 2 months, no contact for him to call me. Finally I called him on March 14th, 2025 and he said that he will never ever live with me and he will apply for divorce after May 5th, 2025 (completion of 1 year of marriage). And he said he will contest the divorce with all proofs if I don't agree for mutual consent. His mother called me and said I have mental health issues, I am characterless and so many other things. She wants me out of his life. And now he is also behaving the same way. I have the confidence that with proper counselling and no interference from his mother, we will be able to restart our life again and build a strong bond. But he is dead set on never giving this marriage another chance. I feel like he just used me for physical needs for a few months and is now trying to get rid of me. This is a marriage and I respect it's sanctity and want to protect it. I want to know what will happen if he decides to file a divorce case on the basis of these fights and my emotional reactions towards his toxic insensitivity. Please help!",

        "full_text": "Divyangjan registration with life tax exemption. I am a physically challenged doctor,51 years old, working as a Professor in one of the Medical colleges in Telangana, and a freelance laparoscopic surgeon. I perform surgeries with the help of walking aids. I have emailed and personally submitted a letter to the transport commissioner regarding my car registration as Divyangjan without modification and to extend the life tax exemption for the same in accordance with the G.O of the MoRTH, dated 03 Feb 2023 RT-11036/57/2020-MVL which dictates that \"all the states should register the vehicle of the PWD ownership as Divyangjan if they have benchmark disability of minimum 40% and even if they don't adapt the vehicle as they might hire a driver if not interested in driving or unable to drive. Also extend the exemptions and concessions that are being provided only to the adapted vehicle. This was addressed to all the Principal secretaries of the states and the transport commissioners. After several emails and letters and wait of three months I got a response from the Transport Commissioner's office that Divyangjan vehicle registration is possible even without vehicle adaptation but rejected the exemption of life tax for the vehicle. He also further said that to provide a life tax exemption for the Divyangjan vehicle without adaptation, a G.O. from the Telangana Govt is required. Several emails were sent to both the special chief secretary for transport and roads and to the chief secretary of the state but all are futile. If you google as \" Divyangjan registration\" you can download the G.O. Furthermore the west bengal government implemented the above mentioned G.O. in their state on 29th August 2023 within 5 months after the MoRTH's G.O. was circulated. I bought the vehicle and my TR is going to expire in 10 days and I didn't pay the vehicle's life tax as the case is all about extending the exemption of the life tax for the Divyangjan registered vehicle. I came to know that the TR can be extended but my RTO says \"No\". Can I hire a lawyer to file a petition in the court? Will I win the case? With the petition filed in the court can I drive my vehicle with the temporary registration number plate until the case is resolved? Please answer. Also how long the case is going to run?

            "Dear Client, being a person with benchmark disability, you are eligible for registration of vehicle under the Divyangjan category without adaptation, based on the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) G.O. dated 03 February 2023. However, the Transport Commissioner in Telangana has said that life tax exemption for non-adapted vehicles need a G.O. by the state and you could approach the High Court through a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The challenge would be to the inaction of the state in bringing about the MORTH G.O. and seek directions to exempt your vehicle from life tax as per the central directive. You can seek interim relief to permit usage of your vehicle with the TR, until the case gets resolved. The court would most likely grant such relief because it is in conformance with your fundamental rights and provisions of MoRTH for Divyangjan. The length of the case is as per the court's calendar and may take a few months to one year to get a final resolution. Lawyer charges for such writ petitions are usually in the range of ₹50,000 to ₹1,50,000 based on the complexity and experience of the lawyer.

If you are confident that you have been denied justice you can approach high court with a writ petition on the basis of refusal of the relief by the authorities concerned by filing the correspondences as documentary evidence from your side. You can enquire about the fees from the lawyer you may engage. The time taken for disposal cannot be predicted.",

            "It sounds like you've encountered significant bureaucratic hurdles while trying to secure life tax exemption for your vehicle as a Divyangjan, which is understandably frustrating. Here are some steps and considerations to address your situation legally and practically: 1. Legal Viability of Filing a Petition Strong Grounds: Based on the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) guidelines, you have strong grounds to argue that the state should extend the same benefits to non-adapted vehicles for Divyangjan as to adapted vehicles, especially if those benefits are available in other states like West Bengal. Precedents: The implementation in West Bengal can serve as a precedent, which might strengthen your case. 2. Temporary Registration (TR) Extension Legal Provision: Typically, TR can be extended under certain conditions. Despite your RTO's response, the law generally allows for extensions, especially when registration is delayed due to administrative processes or pending legal matters. Driving with TR: Legally, you cannot drive with an expired TR. You should resolve this either through an extension or by getting the permanent registration done (even if temporarily without the tax exemption) to avoid legal issues related to driving with an expired TR. 3. Filing a Petition Hiring a Lawyer: Given the complexity and specific nature of your case, hiring a lawyer who specializes in disability rights or administrative law would be advisable. A lawyer can draft and file a writ petition in the High Court challenging the decision of the Transport Commissioner's office. Interim Relief: Your lawyer can also file for interim relief to allow you to legally drive the vehicle while the case is being decided. Duration of the Case: The duration of court cases can vary significantly, often taking several months to a year or more, depending on the court's backlog and the specifics of the case. Costs: Legal fees can vary widely. You might expect to pay anywhere from ₹50,000 to several lakhs, depending on the lawyer's reputation, experience, and location. Some lawyers might charge a flat fee, while others could charge by the hour or a percentage of the tax saved. 4. Immediate Actions Consult Multiple Lawyers: Get consultations from several lawyers to understand the potential costs, duration, and likelihood of success. Choose a lawyer who has experience with similar cases and seems most understanding of disability rights. Documentation: Gather all correspondence with the Transport Commissioner, RTO, and any other relevant communications. Also, prepare a detailed narrative of your attempts to resolve the issue administratively, as this will be crucial for your legal case. 5. Continued Advocacy Advocacy Groups: Consider reaching out to disability rights groups and NGOs that might support your cause or have dealt with similar issues before. They can provide both legal resources and additional pressure on authorities through their advocacy efforts. Taking these steps can help you navigate the legal complexities and work toward a resolution that recognizes your rights as a Divyangjan. It’s important to tackle both the immediate legal issues (like the TR extension) and the broader problem (tax exemption) systematically. For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy. Hope you find the information helpful. You are free to contact me for further discussion. If you could spare two minutes of your time to write a review, it would be greatly appreciated and bring immense happiness to read it. Thank you. Shubham Goyal."

Court proceedings of custody case is simply prolonged with further dates as the judge is not giving the order citing that the divorce case is pending. What recourse does the aggrieved father has",
        "answers": [
            "If the wife has disobeyed the court order for visitation rights then you can take legal action against her as per law. The Supreme Court in Roxann Sharma Vs. Arun Sharma - AIR 2015 SC 2232, while dealing with the case of visitation right, considered the Black's Law Dictionary, according to which 'Visitation' means a non-custodial parent's period of access to a child. Visitation right means a non-custodial parent's or grandparent's Court ordered privilege of spending time with a child or grandchild who is living with another person, usually the custodial parent. it was also observed that it is a common practice among couples to use kids as pawns in the game of emotional chess. It amounts to absolutely irresponsible parenting to scar children emotionally post separation. The innocent child is being used as tools of vengeance. Although the non-custodial parent is responsible for the care of the child during visits, visitation differs from custody because non- custodial parent and child do not live together as a family unit. I n our opinion, visitation rights have been ascribed this meaning - In a dissolution or custody suit, permission granted to a parent to visit children. Therefore a contempt of court proceedings can be initiated against the wife for refusing to obey a court order regarding visitation rights, as such refusal constitutes willful disobedience of a court order.",
            "It appears that your wife's act is a wilful disobedience. As suggested you may initiate legal process for contempt proceedings against her. For contempt proceedings to be initiated, the disobedience must be willful, meaning the party intentionally and deliberately refused to comply with the court order. Court orders related to child custody and visitation are considered \"coercive\" or \"injunctive\" orders, meaning they are designed to compel a party to act or refrain from acting in a specific way. you may discuss with your advocate and initiate contempt proceedings in the same court instead of looking for solution through an irrelevant legal forum",
            "If the interim order for visitation rights was granted in the RCR case and subsequently the rCR case stands dismissed then the IAs in the suit will also be disposed on the disposal of the main case. In general, when a suit is dismissed, any interim orders or IA (Interlocutory Application) orders related to that suit, including temporary injunctions, cease to be effective. you may please note that when your rCR case was dismissed . any interlocutory orders, such as those related to visitation rights or other interim reliefs, are automatically dissolved, regardless of whether the dismissal was for default or on the merits. Therefore there is no contempt of court proceedings may be initiated against her because she cannot be compelled to comply with the non existing court orders. Besides there is no human rights violation hence no complaint would be entertained by the SHRC also, you may have to seek remedy for visitation rights by filing suitable application in the divorce case or file a fresh child custody case to get the relief.",

Dear Lawyer, I need legal guidance regarding a legitimate Binance P2P transaction that has now been linked to a cyber fraud case in India. I am an NRI residing outside India and currently unable to visit the police station or cyber crime office in Uttar Pradesh to resolve the issue in person. Scenario: On 8th January 2025, I sold USDT worth INR 50,000/- via Binance Peer-to-Peer (P2P) to a verified buyer who transferred the amount to my Axis Bank account. I conducted due diligence by verifying the buyer’s identity through Binance-provided details and KYC documents, ensuring it was *not a third-party transaction*. After confirming that the sender’s name matched the buyer’s name on Binance, I released the USDT via Binance’s escrow mechanism. I later received an email from Axis Bank’s Cyber Cell stating that a lien (not a freeze) has been placed on the said transaction of 50k on my bank account as per instructions from the Cyber Crime Police of Uttar Pradesh, alleging that the transferred funds were linked to a fraud case. As a NCRP case was filled by the victim (third person) who was scammed by the buyer who purchased USDT from me. I am now considered a Layer 2 recipient in this case since the fraudster (who tok INR from Victim and sent me that INR to buy Crypto USDT) used my Binance P2P order to liquidate stolen funds into crypto. Current Status & Supporting Evidence: I have all supporting proof, including: Digitally signed Binance order receipts for the transaction. Bank statements showing the transaction. KYC details of the buyer (Aadhar/Pan) Details of Binance’s legal portal for law enforcement inquiries Despite my attempts to contact the investigating officer, the provided contact number is out of coverage, and I am unable to get any clarification on the next steps. My Concerns & Queries: 1. Am I legally liable for the fraud committed by the buyer who used my Binance P2P order to buy USDT? 2. Can the police demand that I compensate the victim for their loss, even though I was not involved in the fraud. 3. Can i be arrested? I have just emailed the cyber police with the proofs & a video stmt - but unable to contact them on call as their number is un-reachable (I got their email id & number from NCRP notice sent by my Bank). 4. How do I respond to an upcoming 91/102 Cr.P.C. notice if issued by the police? 5. Since I am an NRI and unable to appear in person, how else can formally communicate my response to the police? 6. What steps can I take to avoid getting dragged into a legal case or unnecessary proceedings? 7. The NCRP case was lodged in UP and my home state in india is Gujarat.

June 2021,she file DV against me and parents. Feb 2025,district court has ordered D. V interim maintenance.10,000Rs to each child of two children's and no maintenance / zero maintenance to wife. I have twins children's 1 son and 1 daughter, 7 years old. I am from Pune, wife and children's also stay in Pune at separate residence. My gross income 1,45,000 Per month, in hand 1,05,000 Rs. Her income 49000 Rs at time of filing income affidavit in 2021.After that she changed her job but not updated to court. I submitted her gross income 14 L per anim got by RTI from IT department. But, court not considered this. Court ordered maintenance on 13 th Feb based on my gross income Rs 145000 per month, not considered my in hand salary 1,05,000.And court considered my wifes last company salary 49000Rs, not latest income 14L I have only 5 days to file appeal in session court as 30 days since interim maintenance order is expiring o 12th March My questions: 1 Does 10,000 Rs maintenance for 7 year child living in Pune is reasonable ? 2 Should I appeal to session court to consider my in hand salary and wifes latest income 14L 3 Maintenance arrears are 9L.if I go for appeal in session court, how much % arrears I will have to pay? 4 By appeal to session court can I get stay for interim maintenance? 5 with appeal to session court, how much maintenance would reduce and how much chances?",

But you could say that it may not sufficiently cover all expenses concerning education, healthcare, and general living expenditures of the child. If a meticulous analysis of the child's needs has to be propounded, you could expect a revision for it. It might be better to file an appeal keeping in mind that your actual in-hand salary is Rs. 1,05,000 and also bring your wife's current income of Rs. 14 lakhs per annum for the recalculation of maintenance. The revised liability with reference to an arrears of Rs. 9L will depend on what the court calculates the monthly maintenance to be, as there is no preordained percentage for arrears and it all pertains to the fresh order covering the span from the judgment through to the resolution of appeal. You may also seek a stay on the interim maintenance order until the appeal applies. This will be dependent wholly on the direction of the court. However, the amount reduction or increases will be predicated on your proof of actual income and outgoings, bearing in mind the position of your wife that the court judges. You may consult a family lawyer who will give your case a thorough assessment and with whom you will prepare the best appeal to put to the court. I hope this helps. Feel free to inquire for any further legal query.",
            "Legal Strategy to Reduce Maintenance & Challenge the Order Effectively Your case requires urgent legal action since you have only 5 days left to appeal the interim maintenance order.

Should You Appeal to Consider Your In-Hand Salary & Wife’s ₹14L Income? ✔ Yes, absolutely. ✔ Your net in-hand salary (₹1,05,000) should be considered, not gross salary. ✔ Your wife’s latest ₹14L salary must be accounted for, as she is equally responsible for the children. Strong Legal Argument: 3. How Much Arrears (₹9L) Will You Have to Pay If You Appeal? 4. Can You Get a Stay on Interim Maintenance by Appealing? ✔ Yes, the Sessions Court can stay the order, especially if: ✔ A well-drafted appeal can reduce the financial burden and delay enforcement of the arrears. 5. How Much Can Maintenance Be Reduced & What Are Your Chances? ✔ With proper legal arguments, maintenance can be reduced significantly, as: ✔ Chance of Reduction: Very High if argued effectively. ✔ Possible Outcome: Maintenance can be lowered by 30-50%. Next Steps – Immediate Legal Action Required Since time is critical, I can: ✔ Draft and file the appeal within 5 days. ✔ Seek a stay on the interim order to pause arrears. ✔ Ensure your wife’s ₹14L salary and EMI payments are properly considered.

Now at the time of purchase my brother transferred some amount in my bank account just as assistance in the purchase and after the sale was done I transferred the half of that amount back to his account (parents agreed to pay the remaining amount to him ) Now he is claiming a share in the property because of the amount he transferred although there is no agreement stating anything like this. Please advise if his claim in maintainable in the court ?",

The fact that you returned half of the money transferred and the acknowledgment from your parents to settle the rest is a good indication that this money was simply meant as financial assistance and not as consideration for any share in the property. His claim may not survive in the courts, given that there seems to be no evidence, however strong or weak, of an implied trust, a gift, or a contractual obligation resting on your shoulders. All that needs to be done now is to preserve all bank records, communications, and papers regarding these transactions. I recommend that you contact a property lawyer to review the matter and effectively protect your rights. Hope this helps. Feel free to inquire for any legal query.",

His transfer of money was assistance, not a contribution towards ownership. ✔ No Written Agreement – A property share claim requires a legal document or registered agreement, which he does not have. ✔ No Name on Property Title – The registered ownership remains with you and your wife, making it difficult for him to claim a stake. ✔ You Partially Repaid Him – You already returned half of the amount, showing no intention of co-ownership. ✔ Oral Claims Hold No Legal Value – Courts rely on documented proof, not just verbal statements. Solution: If you want to avoid further disputes, you can: ✔ Clear the remaining amount and take a signed acknowledgment from him that the transaction is settled. ✔ Draft a legal agreement stating that the money was only financial assistance, not for ownership. ❌ No provision allows him to claim ownership without proof of investment. ✔ The only thing he can do is file a recovery suit for the unpaid amount, not demand property rights. ✔ Send him a legal notice clarifying that his financial assistance does not entitle him to ownership. ✔ If he files a suit, contest it on grounds of lack of evidence. ✔ Document all financial transactions to avoid future claims.

            "Your husband's legal rights primarily depend on the validity and enforceability of the settlement deed executed by your father-in-law. Based on the facts you've shared, here’s a breakdown of his rights and the legal course of action he can take: Right to 1/4th Share – If the settlement deed was legally executed and registered 18 years ago, your husband is entitled to exactly 1/4th of the property, and no one can arbitrarily reduce his share. Deed Cannot Be Altered – Once a registered settlement deed is executed, it cannot be changed or revoked unilaterally unless there was a clause allowing modifications, which is rare. If they have not legally modified the deed, they cannot reduce his share. Fraud & Undue Influence – Since they hid the deed from him for years and are now unilaterally making decisions against the original settlement terms, there is a clear case of fraud and unfair division. He has strong legal grounds to challenge this. Right to Partition – If the family is not following the deed’s terms, he can file a suit for partition in court to claim his rightful share. The court will enforce the terms of the settlement deed and ensure a fair division. Right to Injunction – If the other family members are proceeding with construction that unfairly reduces his share, he can file for an injunction to stop further construction or alteration of the property. 🔹 Send a Legal Notice – The first step is to issue a strong legal notice demanding his rightful 1/4th share and warning of legal consequences if denied. This will put pressure on them to settle fairly. 🔹 File a Partition Suit – If they refuse to comply, your husband can file a suit for partition in the civil court, asking for the court to intervene and divide the property as per the deed. 🔹 Seek Compensation – If they have already taken a part of his share and given it to his sister or father, he can claim compensation for the loss. 🔹 Challenge Any Forged Documents – If they attempt to show new documents modifying the settlement, we can legally challenge them for forgery or undue influence. This is a complex property dispute involving hidden documents and unfair practices. I can help you by: ✔ Reviewing the original settlement deed to confirm his exact legal standing. ✔ Drafting a powerful legal notice to demand his full rights. ✔ Filing a partition suit to enforce his rightful share. ✔ Obtaining an injunction if necessary, to stop any unfair construction. I recommend a detailed consultation where I can review the deed and strategize the best legal action. If your husband wants to proceed, I can assist in initiating the legal process immediately.

Your husband can file a suit for partition and claim his share in the property as per the registered settlement deed. Now when the entire property is disputed in the partition suit the other brothers will become scared of losing their share in the property hence there are possibilities for an amicable settlement among everyone, therefore the solution for now is to approach court with a civil suit.",

            "Yes, in India, both partnership firms and sole proprietorships can engage in Futures and Options (F&O) trading. However, it's essential to understand the regulatory and operational nuances associated with each business structure. Sole Proprietorship: As a sole proprietor, you can trade F&O in your name. The profits or losses from such trading are considered non-speculative business income under Section 43(5) of the Income Tax Act and should be reported under \"Income from Business or Profession\" in your Income Tax Return. Partnership Firm: A partnership firm can also participate in F&O trading. While a partnership firm is not a separate legal entity, it can hold shares in the names of its partners, either individually or jointly. The income from F&O trading would be treated as business income for the firm and taxed accordingly. Alternative Structures: Some traders consider forming a One Person Company (OPC) or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) to engage in F&O trading. These structures can offer benefits like limited liability and potential tax advantages. However, they also come with increased compliance requirements. Regulatory Considerations: It's crucial to ensure compliance with the regulations set by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the respective stock exchanges. This includes meeting eligibility criteria and adhering to any restrictions on trading activities. Tax Implications: Regardless of the business structure, income from F&O trading is treated as business income. Proper accounting and timely tax return filings are essential to remain compliant and avoid penalties. In summary, both sole proprietorships and partnership firms can engage in F&O trading in India. However, each structure has its own set of regulatory, tax, and compliance considerations that should be carefully evaluated before proceeding.",
            "Yes, you can trade in Futures & Options (F&O) through a proprietorship or a partnership firm in India, subject to regulatory and tax considerations. To do so, you must open a trading and demat account in the firm’s name with a SEBI-registered stockbroker. A proprietorship firm requires minimal documentation, while a partnership firm needs a registered partnership deed specifying F&O trading as a business activity. From a taxation perspective, F&O income is treated as business income. In a proprietorship, it is taxed as per individual slab rates, whereas a partnership firm is taxed at a flat 30% on profits. Additionally, a tax audit is mandatory if turnover exceeds ₹10 crore or if profits are below 6% of turnover. While GST registration is needed if total turnover exceeds ₹20 lakh, F&O trading itself does not attract GST. For compliance, a proprietorship firm operates under the owner's PAN, whereas a partnership firm requires a separate PAN, GST (if applicable), and a current bank account. If you prefer simplicity and full control, a proprietorship is a better choice. However, if multiple partners are involved, a partnership firm offers a structured approach with shared liability. LLPs and private limited companies can also trade in F&O but involve higher compliance costs under MCA regulations. To set up a proprietorship, you need a current account and a trading account linked to it. For a partnership firm, you must register the firm, draft a partnership deed, obtain a PAN, and open a current account before starting trading. Given the legal and tax implications, choosing the right structure depends on your trading volume and compliance preference. Let me know if you need assistance in setting up a firm or drafting the necessary documents."

            "The main legislative framework, which gives state governments the authority to organize, control, or outlaw lotteries inside their borders, comprises the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998, and the Lotteries (Regulation) Rules, 2010. Because of these rules, lotteries are required to follow stringent regulations to uphold integrity and guard against fraud. However, by addressing the legality of online lottery and the prerequisites for state authorization, the Indian Contract Act of 1872 and the Indian Penal Code of 1860 add even more levels of complication. Although consumer protection laws provide additional protection for lottery players, the legal environment around online lotteries is still complex and differs greatly between jurisdictions. The Indian Penal Code's Section 294A makes it illegal to maintain an office or other location to conduct a lottery without official government authorization. Lotteries need state authorization to lawfully function, and violations can result in jail time and penalties. Lottery participants are protected by the Consumer Protection Act, which guarantees they won't be the victim of unscrupulous business activities or abuse. The legal position on lotteries varies from state to state, necessitating compliance with a thorough grasp of local laws. In several Indian states, lotteries are allowed The states and UTs where lottery is banned in India are: Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Ladakh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Odisha, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Telangana Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Lakshadweep, Delhi, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Private lotteries mainly remain banned, and such a venture may need legal guidance with variations in the laws of the state, with some states like Maharashtra, Kerala, and West Bengal allowing for government-run lotteries whereas others ban them altogether. Under the Consumer Protection Act and the Cable television Network Rules, 1994, advertising online for lotteries is restricted. Consumer protection laws require transparency in ticket sales and in the conduct of lucky draws, to prevent a possible case of unfair trade practice against the company. Tax implications on ticket sales may also arise, with the supplier being liable to pay 18% GST on ticket sales and capital gains tax becoming applicable for winner(s) on property transferred. A lottery license shall be obtained from the Government, and the winner may be required to provide KYC details and comply with seal duties before claiming prizes. Hope this helps. Feel free to ask for any more legal questions."

            "As you know that the Court cannot make a decision without first informing the caveator. It safeguards the caveator's right to be heard in court. Now, the Govt. has already filed the SLP against the judgement passed by the High Court, however, the defects are not cleared since almost 8 months. In any case, caveat have a limited shelf-life of 90 days. If the defects are not removed within 28 days, an application seeking condonation of delay in refiling has to be filed along with the SLP. Once the defects are removed, the SA sends the SLP to the branch officer (BO). This process is called verification. At this stage, the BO scrutinizes whether the case is in order and prepares an office report which also states whether any other identical or similar case is pending before the Supreme Court. He also enters the section or provision of law which the SLP is concerned with. The Registry checks if a caveat has been filed. The AOR has to serve the caveator and give proof of service to the Registry, in order for the SLP to be considered defect free. Once the Branch Officer is satisfied that all defects are removed and that the SLP is in order, he registers the case i.e. he enters the details of the SLP on his computer. A defect free SLP is listed by the listing branch typically within 1 week. Also, please note that anytime soon the SLP (with defects) will be listed. If the defects are not removed till 90 days from the date of communication of the defects, the matter shall be listed with Office Report on default before the Hon'ble Judge in Chambers for appropriate orders and then the matter may be dismissed in default (in non compliance of removing defects). The case can also be reopened after the SLP is dismissed in default, after filing the restoration application (with condonation of delay application).

            "It is not known what orders have been passed by the court against the bank hence it is pertinent to peruse the court orders to render n appropriate opinion in this regard. Cyber crime police can freeze a bank account if they suspect illegal activity, such as fraud, money laundering, or cybercrime. However, the police can only freeze the amount of money involved in the suspected fraud, not the entire account. Legally speaking a bank cannot refuse to release a frozen bank account after a court order. If a bank account is frozen by a court or law enforcement agency, the bank must comply with the order. If the account is frozen due to cyber crime, the Magistrate may allow the account to be unfrozen if the party executes a bond for the concerned amount. If your account is frozen, you can consult a local lawyer with proper details to help you navigate the situation.",

            "Issue legal notice to bank to comply with court orders if no reply is received from bank then file contempt of court proceedings in HC against bank for refusing to comply with court orders",
            "Your concerns regarding the freezing and recovery of cyber crime-related funds involve multiple legal aspects, including compliance with court orders, banking regulations, and writ remedies. Below is a detailed legal opinion addressing your queries: No, a bank cannot unfreeze the amount on its own unless directed by the investigating authority or the court. Freezing of funds in cyber crime cases is done under Section 102 of CrPC (Power of Police to Seize Certain Property) or as per directions of regulatory authorities like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The victim must ensure that the complaint is registered with the jurisdictional police/cyber cell, and once the investigation is concluded, the funds can be released only through a formal direction by the same authority that ordered the freeze. No, a bank cannot refuse to comply with a court order unless it is legally challenged or stayed by a higher court. If the National Cyber Crime Portal has confirmed the freeze and a jurisdictional court has ordered the money to be credited back, non-compliance by the bank may amount to contempt of court under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. The bank may justify refusal only if: If the bank refuses to comply with the court's directive, the victim can: Banks are obligated to follow KYC (Know Your Customer) norms under RBI Guidelines. If a bank negligently opens accounts for cyber criminals, it can be held liable for: If a bank is found complicit in facilitating cyber fraud, the victim can file a Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court, seeking: Notable case laws include: Since your case involves news reports of bank officials' involvement, it strengthens your position in a writ petition for full recovery and compensation. Filing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) may also expose systemic failures in banking regulations.

I have take a Loan Against Property from Cholamandalam (NBFC) ( BT done 5 months ago from Axis Bank) and missed my EMI for the first time and made partial payment also , I have a clear track record of more than 15 years of paying my EMIs on time , However past 6 months have been going through financial crisis , The NBFC team is pursuing me to clear the EMI within the same month , failing which, I have been told they will initiate legal action such as posting Notice on property, reporting to CIBIL and so on . THEY have called my bed ridden father and my wife and tried to reach out to them as they are co applicant / co borrower. I had asked the NBFC authorities in a verbal , to enable me to pay step up EMI (partial amount ) for few months till I am able to manage the challenging time , the authority responded in negative . I also told that I have put my property on sale , they replied it's a time taking process and we can't wait and we are bound to initiate action as per law for further procedures . I also told them that I wished to take Balance Transfer to other Bank .They said as you have missed a single EMI , things will not be easy and this will create a bad impact . They were hell bent to make me pay my balance EMI at any cost ( sell gold/ take loan from friends etc etc) I have not initiated any written or mail communication. Yet . What are the options available for ME ? What are my rights and How to protect myself and the actions associated ? What Are the rights with NBFCs ? How to safeguard myself and what should I tell my father and wife to tackle this ?",

            "1) pay the balance amount for this month EmI 2) You can request finance company to reschedule your loan 3) increase tenure and reduce EMI 4) you can seek balance transfer to another bank 5) if you fail to pay EMi account can be declared NPA if the minimum amount due, as mentioned in the statement, is not paid fully within 90 days from the payment due date mentioned in the statement.",
            "- As per the RBI, the bank should give proper time and offers for the settlement of loan amount. on the ground of health and sudden loss. - The Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act is a powerful instrument in the hands of the banks and financial institutions (FIs) as secured creditors. - In case of default of the emi , the bank can send a notice for the payment and to take legal action to auction the property on which loan was taken. - You can show your poor financial status to the bank after sending a written application - Further, request to give more time to pay after extending the loan tenure.",
            "If you fail to pay an EMI, an NBFC can take legal action, potentially leading to asset seizure, wage garnishment, and a lawsuit, which can negatively impact your credit score and future financial opportunities. Missing payments will be reported to credit bureaus, leading to a drop in your credit score, making it harder to get future loans. Before resorting to legal action, the lender may attempt to negotiate with you or offer a settlement option or you can initiate the same from your end. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has guidelines for personal loan defaulters, and lenders must follow a methodical process for debt recovery, including sending reminders and offering restructuring option. Your lender also has to follow the same. If you don't pay back an unsecured loan in India, the lender may take legal action to recover the outstanding debt. This can involve filing a lawsuit against you, seeking a court order to reclaim the loan amount Therefore you may better pay the pending EMI amount and apply for transfer of loan to any other NBFC or bank to avoid further problems.",
            "You need to pay the emi or can buy sometime from bank if your financial condition is not stable. If your account turns NPA bank may initiate action under Sarfesi act against you",
            "Dear Client, As you have a Loan Against Property (LAP) with Cholamandalam (NBFC) and have defaulted on an EMI for the first time because of financial constraints, you must safeguard your rights while dealing with the lender. Here is a legal approach to deal with the situation efficiently: 1. Your Rights as a Borrower No Immediate Legal Action for First Default: Having no single EMI does not necessarily result in legal proceedings. NBFCs must follow RBI’s guidelines and cannot harass or intimidate borrowers. They can only initiate legal recovery after 90 days of continuous non-payment, when the account is classified as NPA (Non-Performing Asset). Protection Under RBI’s Fair Practices Code: NBFCs cannot use coercion, threats, or harassment to collect dues. They must provide written notices before taking legal action. Calling a home-bound father and harassing family members is againstlaw and RBI protocols. Right to Seek Restructuring of EMI: According to RBI's Resolution Framework, the financially stressedborrowers can approach a loan restructuring. The lender cannot deny a Step-Up EMI or Loan Restructuring Request outright. Right Against Public Notice or CIBIL Reporting Without Due Process: NBFCs cannot serve notices on your property or report to CIBIL without going through due process. CIBIL impact only occurs after continuous 90-day default (NPA classification). 2. What the NBFC Can Legally Do? Initiate Legal Recovery After 90 Days of Non-Payment: If you fail to pay 3 consecutive EMIs, they can classify the loan as NPA and initiate recovery under the SARFAESI Act, 2002. They must issue a 60-day demand notice before taking possession of the property. Report Default to CIBIL After Prolonged Non-Payment: If you fail to pay beyond 90 days, they may report your account as NPA, impacting your credit score. A single missed EMI will not immediately affect CIBIL. Reject Balance Transfer Requests in Case of Default: Since you missed an EMI, other banks may hesitate to approve a balance transfer. However, if you clear pending EMIs, you can apply again. 3. How to Protect Yourself? (A) Send a Written Communication to NBFC Immediately email/write to Cholamandalam, stating: You are facing temporary financial hardship but are committed to repayment. You request a Step-Up EMI plan or a Restructuring option. You have put the property on sale and need time to arrange funds. You are willing to pay partial EMIs consistently to avoid default classification. Request a written response to ensure legal protection. (B) Prevent Harassment of Family Members Formally complain to NBFC’s grievance redressal cell stating: Family harassment is against RBI’s Fair Practices Code. Calls to your bedridden father and wife violate collection norms. If harassment continues, you will file a police complaint and escalate to RBI Ombudsman. (C) Ensure They Follow Legal Recovery Steps (If It Reaches That Stage) If you are over 90 days past due: They must issue a 60-day SARFAESI notice before taking legal action. You can still repay during this period to stop property attachment. (D) Keep Your Property Sale/Balancing Transfer Option Open Once you clear the pending EMI, apply for balance transfer with another bank. Where balance transfer is unsuccessful, negotiation with NBFC to restructure for a longer period loan can assist. 4. What to Tell Your Father & Wife? Instruct them NOT to entertain NBFC calls. If NBFC representatives visit home, politely inform them that: All communication should happen directly with you. Harassment complaints will be filed if they continue targeting family. Ask them to keep records of any harassing calls (date, time, and conversation summary) for legal complaints. 5. Next Steps ✅ Step 1: Write an immediateemail/letter requesting EMI restructuring or part payments. ✅ Step 2: Lodge a grievance complaint against family harassment to NBFC’s Customer Care & RBI Ombudsman. ✅ Step 3: If harassment continues, file a police complaint for intimidation and mental harassment. ✅ Step 4: If unable to pay fully, ensure at least partial payments to avoid NPA classification. ✅ Step 5: Seek out balance transfer features or negotiate a longer loan period. Final Advice Do NOT panic—a single missed EMI will not result in immediate legal action or property loss. Document all communications with NBFC to protect yourself legally. Seek balance transfer options after settling overdue EMI. If harassment continues, report complaints to the RBI Ombudsman."

        "full_text": "Legal Advice Needed: Adoption Documentation Concerns After Retirement. Background: I'm a 70-year-old retired police man from a Hindu joint family. I was reportedly adopted by my uncle (Late Sh D. Rai) when I was 2 years old (around 1956). My biological father (Late Sh N. Rai) was my adoptive father's elder brother. All parties involved, including both my biological and adoptive parents, have since passed away. Key Points: Career History: Served in State Police, retired in 2014 as ASI/LDC Throughout my service, my adoptive father's name was used in all official documents Initial recruitment papers and appointment letter listed my adoptive father's name There was/is no mention of either name of my biological or adoptive father in my matriculation mark sheet or Board pass certificate, except my name, DOB, and roll number etc due to the then existing System of the Board. Current Documentation Status: No formal adoption papers available Have a notarized affidavit from my adoptive father stating he adopted me at age 2 Have a supporting notarized affidavit from my aunt All current official documents (Aadhaar, PAN, Voter ID, Bank accounts, pension papers) list my adoptive father's name Family Structure: Part of a joint family with 4 brothers and 1 sister I am the eldest among siblings Was raised in biological parents' home for education while adoptive father served elsewhere Concern: I'm worried about potential future complications for myself and my children due to the lack of formal adoption documentation. My adoptive father's name has been used in all official records throughout my life and career, but there are no formal adoption papers. Query: What legal steps should I take to regularize my adoption status and protect my children from any future complications? Need advice on the proper course of action to ensure legal validity of my adoption.",
        "answers": [
            "For valid adoption among Hindus it is necessary that there should be giving and taking ceremony 2) deed of adoption ought to have been executed 3) After adoption, your original birth certificate should be amended to reflect your adoptive parents as your legal parent 4) in your case there is no record of any formal adoption 4) If official documents are missing, credible witnesses who were present at the adoption ceremony can provide valuable testimony in court 5) in the case of Thavamani vs. The Special Tahsilar (ADW) Devakottai and another, it has been held that in the case Kirhori Lal v Mt. Chalibai [AIR 1959 SC 504] the Honourable Supreme Court observed: \"An adoption results in changing the course of succession, depriving wives and daughters of their rights and transferring properties to comparative strangers or more remote relations it is necessary that evidence to support it should be such that it is free from all suspicions of fraud and so consistent and probable as to leave no occasion for doubting its truth. 6) In the case of a Hindu, long recognition as an adopted son, raises a strong presumption in favour of the validity of his adoption, arising from the possibility of the loss of his rights in his own family by being adopted in another family. In the case of an ancient adoption evidence showing that the boy was treated by relations, including the person who later on challenges the same, for a long time as the adopted son at the time when there was no controversy is sufficient to prove the adoption although evidence of actual giving and taking is not forthcoming.",
            "If can’t regularise the same and your children will not have any legal issues for your being not having proper legal documents for adoption you don’t raise the issue yourself just counter the same legally if it’s raised by anyone",
            "Your adoption is governed by Hindu law expounded by ancient texts as at the time of your adoption neither Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, Juvenile Justice Act nor Adoption Regulations, 2022 were in force. What was required then was only the act of giving the boy by biological father and taking of the boy by adoptive father, no documents were required then. “The giving and receiving are absolutely necessary to the valid adoption. They are the operative part of the ceremony, being that part of it which transfers the boy from one family to another.” This is the law laid down in 1980 by Madras High Court in Ranganayakamma v. Akwar Setti and still valid. But there is some gray area, admitted by you, “Was raised in biological parents' home for education while adoptive father served elsewhere.” Transfer of boy to adoptive family is necessary condition. Proof in favor of adoption far outweigh the proof against it. Documents available are sufficient to demolish andy challenge to adoption.",
            "Dear client: The Supreme Court has ruled that the mere registration of an adoption deed does not absolve a person from proving the fact of adoption. Bombay High Court ruling The Bombay High Court has ruled that if there are other documents which can sufficiently establish the claims of adoption, then an adoption deed is not needed. Like photos with adoptive parents, all ur educational documents and other documents..and where ever ur adoptive parents did signature in ur school, collage or any other documents in. parents signature Calum.. And u can also prepare a Affidavit by declaring about ur adoption by mentioning all details like adoption date , ur age at the time of adoption, and about ur educational documents and other documents which has Father's name ( adoptive Father's name) .. By submitting all these things r sufficient to prove ur adoption",
            "At this stage, since your service records and other personal identity cards are having your adoptive father's name alone, you were recognised as the son of your adoptive father all through your life and to establish the facts, your identity proofs, service records corroborate your status as adopted son of your adoptive father. Besides, you have an affidvit also to prove the adoption hence in my opinion your worries at the age of 70 years in this regard is unnecessary. Your children should not face any problem due to your adoption status."

Please answer these questions. 4) I have more queries. I want to hire a lawyer to guide me, assist/help me, answer all my doubts and queries. I will pay the required fee. (I am regretting for not hiring lawyer earlier itself. Already the case is a complex one. I think I didn't follow the usual format while drafting the complaint. I think CA is also not written in usual format, but they are already submitted. and many other issues are coming) Context: I have filed Medical Negligence case in my district consumer forum, without lawyer (due to some personal, financial issues). Chronology of events: Aug 2024: I have filed the complaint along with some medical literature documents. Nov6: Final deadline for filing Written Version(WV) of OPs, but not filed. So, the date for filing the Chief Affidavit(CA) of Complainant(Dec10) is given. Nov9: Lawyer of OPs filed WV of OPs along with IA on Nov9. After going through the WV of OPs, I felt that they have said some lies and they also criticised medical literature I have mentioned in my complaint. So, I felt that I should submit additional documents for supporting my allegations and disprove the arguments made by OPs in their WV. When I asked the superintendent in court, he said that I can't file rejoinder, but I can file additional documents along with the Chief affidavit. (He didn't say anything about filing IA). So, in the CA, I included extra paragraphs (under the heading: Reply to WV of OPs) countering some points of WV of OPs, and also mentioned additional medical literature. Dec6: Dec10 is the date for filing CA. But our family is going on a trip on Dec7-13. So, the Superintendent said he will submit the CA & additional documents on behalf of me. I gave CA and additional documents to Superintendent. Dec7: Superintendent submitted the CA & additional documents to court on behalf of me. (But date for filing them is Dec10). The CA and additional documents are received and signed by staff in court, but they are not marked as CA. (Maybe because they are submitted before Dec10, and also IA of OPs is pending) Jan: IA filed by OPs is pending. I am told by a higher staff in court that I have to file IA for filing additional documents along with the CA. And the date for filing CA is given as Feb13. But the CA along with additional documents are already submitted to court on Dec7 itself by Superintendent. The CA is signed but not marked as CA.

Yes, you can file additional documents along with the Chief Affidavit, especially if they are relevant to counter the written version (WV) of the opposite parties (OPs) or strengthen your case. However, since these documents were not part of your original complaint, the opposite party may object to their inclusion, and the court may require you to file an Interlocutory Application (IA) seeking permission to submit these additional documents. 2) Do I have to submit an IA for filing additional documents along with the CA of the complainant? Yes, since these documents were not initially filed with the complaint, it is advisable to file an IA requesting permissionto submit the additional documents. The IA should clearly state: Since the staff has indicated that an IA is required, it is best to file one to ensure that your additional documents are officially taken on record. 3) If I have to submit IA for submitting additional documents along with CA, do I have to file an additional affidavit in support of this IA? Yes, you should file an affidavit in support of the IA, affirming that: The affidavit should be on stamp paper and notarized, as required by consumer forum procedural rules. 4) You want to hire a lawyer to assist you with all queries and guide you through the case.

However, it has been 24 hours, and the next hearing date or any court orders haven't been updated yet. In the past, updates were usually posted by the same evening of the hearing. I would like to seek your advice on two things: - Why might there be a delay, and is this normal? - How many days should I wait before having my lawyer inquire about this directly from the registrar or the judge’s reader?",
        "answers": [
            "File application for inspection and inspect the court file. It takes time in updation of orders in court websites. As such there is no delay. There is no reason to be panic.",
            "Yes. Judge might have fixed date but same has not been updated on court website. It is a normal practice. As such there is no delay on part of court. so you must file application for inspection. Also apply for certified copy of order.",
            "You need take circulation of the matter is not listed by Hc. There is no other way. If you want to speed the case then you need to apply the SC for the same",
            "Thank you for reaching out. Your concern is completely valid, especially since the judge explicitly prioritized the case and directed a short date for disposal. Let’s address your queries with a practical and professional approach to ensure swift action: Yes, occasional delays in updating hearing dates and orders are not uncommon, even when the judge has directed urgency. Possible reasons include: ✔ Administrative Backlog: The judge may have dictated the order, but the court staff (registrar, bench clerk, or reader) might not have processed it yet. ✔ Pending Signature: The judge’s order might be awaiting final approval or signature before being uploaded. ✔ Technical Issues: The court’s online system may not have updated due to backend delays. ✔ Clerical Oversight: In some cases, if the order was dictated in open court, it might take 24-48 hours for clerical staff to formally enter it into the system. 🚨 However, since the judge stressed urgency, this delay should not stretch beyond a couple of days. Since this is an urgent matter and standard updates are usually posted by the evening of the hearing, waiting too long is not advisable. The best approach is: Yes, if the order has been passed but not updated online, an inspection will reveal the status. Here’s how: ✔ Step 1: Your lawyer must file a simple application for inspection under the respective High Court Rules. ✔ Step 2: Submit the application at the court’s filing section and pay a nominal fee (if required). ✔ Step 3: Upon approval, you or your lawyer will be allowed to inspect the physical/digital file to check if the order has been recorded. 📌 Why This Helps: ✔ Step 1 (Now): Have your lawyer check with the court’s cause list & orders section to see if the update is pending due to administrative reasons. ✔ Step 2 (Within 48 Hours): If no update, approach the registrar/judge’s reader in person to verify if the order is recorded but not uploaded. ✔ Step 3 (After 72 Hours, if needed): File a formal inspection application to access the court file and confirm if the order has been passed. Since your case is being treated as urgent, any delay should be addressed immediately to ensure compliance with the judge’s direction. I can assist in drafting the inspection application or any follow-up legal documents to speed up the process. Let me know how you'd like to proceed, and we can take decisive legal action without wasting time.",
            "The High court may not have uploaded the daily orders even though it has passed the speaking orders. Your advocate may make an enquiry from the concerned court office about the orders passed on that date of hearing and let you know. It is not unusual."

We appealed in Session court which goes a step further and said in its order \"Where is the domestic voilence when you haven';t stayed together? and this is gross misuse of this law. We sighted Prabha Tyagi judgement where Honorable Supreme court has held that I quote Whether it is mandatory for the aggrieved person to reside with those persons against whom the allegations have been levied at the point of commission of violence?” It is held that it is not mandatory for the aggrieved person, when she is related by consanguinity, marriage or through a relationship in the nature of marriage, adoption or are family members living together as a joint family, to actually reside with those persons against whom the allegations have been levelled at the time of commission of domestic violence.

            "Dear Client, Thank you for your query. According to the SARFAESI Act of 2002, it is the secured creditor alone who is entitled to issue a Section 13(2) notice. In this situation, since the NBFC availed a loan from a public sector bank under the 90:10 pool buyout arrangement and the loan is reported to CIBIL in the borrower's name by the bank, the NBFC is perhaps powerless to invoke the SARFAESI proceedings unless it has retained a portion of the loan, security interest, or credit risk. Whether the NBFC can invoke SARFAESI depends upon the *specific terms of the buyout agreement, the securitization structure, and whether the NBFC still qualifies as a secured creditor. It is appropriate that you analyze the loan documentation and the assertions made in the buyout here to appropriately determine its lawful position. Hope this helps.

Under the proposed scheme, an NBFC sells a pool of assets (say, a set of affordable loans or loans in a certain category or geography) to a PSB in return for immediate payment. The SARFAESI Act can be invoked against a borrower even if an NBFC \"pools out\" a loan, meaning it sells the loan to another financial institution, as long as the NBFC originally created the secured debt and meets the eligibility criteria under the SARFAESI Act, including having an asset size exceeding Rs. 100 crore and the loan amount being above Rs. 50 lakh; the new lender can then utilize the Act to recover the debt from the borrower if it becomes an NPA.",

The unusual reporting of the pool buyout loan under the borrower's name in CIBIL does not affect the NBFC's rights to enforce security under SARFAESI, provided all legal conditions are met.

            "Your interest in purchasing agricultural land is commendable, but there are serious legal risks involved in this transaction. If you do not conduct a thorough title verification and take legal precautions, you could face years of litigation and financial loss. Below is a professional legal assessment of your case, based on Indian property law, Karnataka land laws, and the Limitation Act, 1963. Key Legal Issue: Unregistered Partition Deed (2008) The 2008 Partition Deed is Legally Invalid Mutation Records Do Not Prove Legal Ownership Risk of a Civil Suit for Partition & Cancellation of Sale Deeds Does the Limitation Act Protect You? You have mentioned Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963, which states: 🔴 In Your Case: Thus, Article 65 does not guarantee protection, and the siblings can still challenge the sale in court. Potential Risks If You Purchase This Land ✅ Risk of Litigation: The siblings may file a partition suit demanding their rightful share, leading to a long legal battle of 5-10 years. ✅ Possible Cancellation of Sale Deed: If a court declares that Mr.1 did not have absolute ownership, the sale from Mr.1 to Mr.Y, Mr.Y to Mr.Z, and from Mr.Z to you can all be canceled. ✅ Financial Loss: If a court cancels the sale, you will lose your money and might face eviction from the land. ✅ Encumbrance Risk: The siblings may obtain an injunction preventing any further sale or development on the land, blocking your investment. Legal Steps You Must Take Before Buying This Land Get a Title Verification from an Expert Advocate Get a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from Mr.1’s Siblings File a Public Notice in Newspapers Obtain a Legal Indemnity Bond from Mr. Z Final Legal Advice: Proceed with Caution! 🚨 DO NOT finalize the purchase until: ✔ The title is legally verified. ✔ All legal heirs sign a registered relinquishment deed. ✔ A legal notice is issued inviting objections. ✔ An experienced property lawyer drafts all documents.

For green card he got his indian passport updated showing me as his wife, but we never got our marriage formally registered in India. In oct 2024, he left our house in oregon and stopped all communication from me and my family. His parnets ar ejn USA and no other family is picking our phone calls. In December 2024 he filed for divorce in USA, we live in Oregon which is a no fault divorce state.

You may have to contest the divorce case filed by him at US.",

You can file anti suit injunction in India also so that your husband is restrained from pursuing his divorce suit in USA any further. 3.

It is not clear what do you mean by ' court marriage'.",
            "Dear Client, While your wedding was performed in the USA and not formally registered in India, there arise complexities to have it legitimized under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (HMA), as the latter shall apply to marriages performed in India under Hindu customs. Nevertheless, if your marriage meets all the statutory requirements, it may be recognized under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969 (FMA), and hence you may prefer to have it registered either under FMA or Special Marriage Act, 1954 (SMA). Now, concerning the divorce proceedings pending in Oregon, India would not automatically recognize a foreign divorce decree unless it is passed on a valid ground provided under Indian laws, hence you may challenge its validity in India. Also, you may prefer child custody under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, and Section 26 of HMA, and seek maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC or Section 24 and 25 of HMA for yourself and your daughter. If he abandoned you without any support, then you might also consider sending a legal notice or filing for desertion, domestic violence, or financial abandonment. This is a serious issue, and thus an Indian family law expert is recommended to resolve the subsequent proceedings in court. Hope this helps. Feel free to reach out for further clarification.",

            "Dear Client, Thank you for shedding light on the details of your case. Given the facts so revealed, the wife may not be able to gain her interests in a mutual divorce without conditions. The husband has Gold and the property, which he is not returning. In general, a mutual divorce is put forth to conclude all disputes, including financial and property relations. Pursuing this further without addressing these issues may hurt her in any possible later confrontation on these matters. The wife can file an application under the Domestic Violence Act for her streedhan (gold and property) to get it back. The law recognizes streedhan to be the exclusive property of the wife, and its alleged unlawful retention by the husband makes her case in favor of a claim for it stronger. Evidence such as bills, photographs, or witness testimonies must be presented to establish that the husband retains possession of the gold and property. This is a very important step to uphold her rightful claims. Although mutual divorce will be speedier, conditions should be added to preserve the interests of the wife over property and financial aspects. In case the husband refuses any settlement, the wife can oppose the petition as filed by the husband and continue with the DVC and 498A cases. Both the cases require evidence to present to the court. It is crucial to avoid focussing on evidence like police complaints and medical reports, giving proof of harassment or abuse. The courts generally remain cautious with the 498A cases; hence it is important to substantiate the allegations. If mutual divorce is impossible because of the husband’s obstinate attitude, the wife can go for contested divorce while continuing with her legal claims. Such cases may take up a long time, but they can compel the husband to a negotiation. The wife may apply for maintenance, posession orders, or other relief under the Domestic Violence Act to meet her in all basic needs. It is necessary to take very firmly a family lawyer who will act in the wife’s interest. Provided a competent and strong legal battle plan and some capacities, the wife can surely set her foot on the roadmap toward reclaiming her property and getting a fair settlement to the dispute.

Fast forward to today, my father and mother are no more. It turned out the father really did not have any significant assets in his name. Now the other two of my siblings are insisting that they have a share in my flat. They say they have some cheques that show the flat was purchased by my father. And indirectly the flat belonged to him. They say the deed that I signed with my brother establishes that they have a right to the flat too. Do they have a legal claim or is it a ploy to extort money out of me ? The flat was purchased for me by my father. The deed with my one sibling was signed only to get rid of any future problem. Unfortunately I have nothing on paper which says that father gifted the flat to me. I am willing to fight in court. But I would like to get a opinion online first before contacting a lawyer. I am hoping that the courts will decide the case quickly in my favor.",

Your siblings cannot claim a share unless they prove it was purchased by your father with his funds and intended to benefit all heirs. Here’s the situation: You can sell the flat unless a court injunction stops you. Even if your siblings file a case, they must present strong evidence. Your chances of winning are high, given the registration in your name. For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy. Hope this helps!

            "It is in your interest to give your siblings share in the flat litigation is a long drawn and an expensive proposition An out of court settlement with your siblings is the best option your siblings can win the court case",
            "The property was purchased by your father on your name by a registered sale deed, hence it becomes your own and absolute property. In fact you were not even a minor by age at that time hence it cannot be claimed as a gift also. There's no evidence to prove that your father funded for the purchase of this property. Besides it can be proved through your employment details that owing to your employment at various places you permitted your parents and siblings to live in the property till you returned. The indemnity bond you obtained from your brother while financially helping him shows that you helped him at the time of crisis and as a return you have asked him to not to harass you by claiming any share in your share out of your father's property or your own property. All these clearly prove that this property belongs exclusively to you alone hence any claim made by your siblings is not legally maintainable. You can challenge them properly in court of law."

During the payment process the sales representatives mentioned that if Im unhappy with the services I can cancel at any time and they will refund it on a pro rata basis deducting for services used. 3. The start date of said membership is Feb 1, 2025. 4. During my attempt to get a holiday booked through them from Feb 10th to Feb 14th I realised that they are selling air. None of their good properties have availability which they use to sell the membership and the booking process is a hassle. 5. I requested for cancelation of membership on 11/125 to the sales rep on whatsapp. He promised to remedy the situation so I gave him time till 16/1/25. He reverted on 16/125 saying he cannot do it 6. I sent official cancelation email requesting refund as I have not availed any services and membership has not yet started 7. the response I got was that since its been greater than 15 days since payment date, 40% of membership fee is only refundable and 60% is non refundable admin fees as per their terms and conditions. 8. Since I paid only 30% of the complete fee, they claim that the whole paid amount is non-refundable 9. I argued that technically I did inform their sales rep within the 15 days period on whatsapp but they are quoting that I need to send official mail and that date counts. I also argued that this is in breach of Consumer protection act, 2019 2(46) and 2(47) and Indian law supercedes private contract on a case by case basis especially if services were not obtained at all and service hasn't officially commenced as well 10.

If the sale of property was executed at the government rate then it cannot be considered as a deceitful act hence the revenue department may not entertain any such complaint. Without documentary evidence the commissioner of police also may not entertain any complaint . If there is proof to prove that the POA agent has accumulated Auden wealth and not paid taxes then a complaint for tax evasion can be made with documentary evidences to prove the allegations.

He let his second wife and a female friend live there and refuses to vacate. Despite multiple requests, he demands ₹2 lakhs to leave but hasn’t guaranteed he’ll vacate even if we pay. The other four families (including heirs of the deceased sons) agree to sell the property and share the proceeds equally. However, the youngest son is obstructing the sale, demanding his share and ₹2 lakhs. Partitioning the property is complicated as his portion includes the last pillar, which could make selling difficult. We approached the police for help, but they refused to file a case. To add to this, the fourth son is exploiting the situation and trying to buy out the shares of others at a low price.

According to Hindu law, a property cannot be sold without the consent of other family members, so if you want to sell your family-owned property, you will need the consent of all family members before selling it. Therefore it is advisable that you file a suit before concerned to sell the property through court and distribute the sale consideration amount to the shareholders as per law or you can file a suit for partition.

Indian courts may scrutinise the foreign decree extensively to ensure compliance with Indian matrimonial laws, which can lead to delays and procedural hurdles.

This ensures a straightforward and legally binding resolution, avoiding the complexities of validation and enforcement at a later stage. Thanks and Regards, Advocate Aman Verma, Legal Corridor",
            "Hello, To validate a foreign divorce decree in India, especially when the marriage took place in India and was registered under Indian laws, involves a specific legal process. Here’s a concise guide to help you understand how to proceed: Obtain the Original Divorce Decree: First, ensure you receive the original divorce decree or a certified true copy from the Canadian court that issued it. Hire a Lawyer in India: It’s advisable to consult with a lawyer in India who specializes in matrimonial law. The lawyer will guide you through the necessary steps and help in dealing with any legal formalities. File for Execution of Foreign Decree: Under Section 44A of the Civil Procedure Code, a foreign decree can be executed in India if the country where the decree was issued reciprocates legal processes with India. Canada and India have such a reciprocal arrangement. Your lawyer in India can file a petition for the execution of the foreign decree with the appropriate district court in India. Provide Supporting Documents: Alongside the divorce decree, you may need to provide documents that prove your marriage (like the marriage certificate from India), evidence of your and your spouse’s residence in Canada, and proof of the divorce proceedings held in Canada. Verification Process: The Indian court will verify if the divorce decree adheres to the principles of natural justice, if it was issued by a competent court, and if both parties were duly represented. It must also ensure that the decree does not contravene Indian laws. Decree Validation: Once the decree is recognized by the Indian court, it becomes valid in India. The court might issue an order declaring the foreign decree effective in India, thus dissolving the marriage legally under Indian law. Update Marital Status: After the decree is validated, you can use it to update your marital status in government records or for any re-marriage procedures in India. This process can take a few months depending on the complexity of the case, the workload of the courts, and how effectively the proceedings are managed by your legal counsel.

The builder may rectify the same either by a supplementary agreement or a rectification deed but ensure that the subsequent document is executed by a registered deed and also you may exercise caution and properly peruse the papers referred to you seeking your consent before signing it."

Hi, I ,Had a company dealing with Principal Business of sale / purchase / construction of Real estate, In our Companies \"MOA\" we also mentioned in our Business object as \" Hire purchase\", So I want to know weather we can do \"Hire purchase \"Business \" In same company with out obtaining NBFC permission from \"RBI\" , As long as i come under \" RBI\" 50-50 test Rule. FROM RBI WEB SITE: What does conducting financial activity as “principal business” mean? Financial activity as principal business is when a company’s financial assets constitute more than 50 per cent of the total assets and income from financial assets constitute more than 50 per cent of the gross income. A company which fulfils both these criteria will be registered as NBFC by RBI. The term 'principal business' is not defined by the Reserve Bank of India Act. The Reserve Bank has defined it so as to ensure that only companies predominantly engaged in financial activity get registered with it and are regulated and supervised by it. Hence if there are companies engaged in agricultural operations, industrial activity, purchase and sale of goods, providing services or purchase, sale or construction of immovable property as their principal business and are doing some financial business in a small way, they will not be regulated by the Reserve Bank. Interestingly, this test is popularly known as 50-50 test and is applied to determine whether or not a company is into financial business.",
        "answers": [
            "The Reserve Bank of India has clarified that for a company to be classified as an NBFC, to decide on its principal business, it will have to satisfy the two tests of assets and income. The financial assets should be more than 50% of the total assets (netted off by intangible assets), and the income from financial assets should be more than 50% of the gross income. These tests need to be satisfied for a company to be regarded as an NBFC. 2) you don’t need RBI permission as NBFC",
            "The conditions described by are enabling restrictions. Only a company doing financial activity of more than 50% of assets and income as per the conditions stated is entitled to be registered as NFBC.",
            "A hire purchase business is a business activity of a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC). NBFCs are companies that are registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). A real estate business can be involved in hire purchase agreements for assets other than real estate. Hire purchase agreements are a way to finance assets without transferring ownership. A real estate business can consider hire purchase as a financing option, but it should evaluate the financial viability of the proposal. The option with the lower present value of cash outflows is usually the better choice. The 50-50 rule, or 50-50 test, is a test used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to determine if a company is a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC). The test is based on whether a company's financial assets and income from financial assets make up more than half of its total assets and income. If a company's financial assets are more than 50% of its total assets, it passes the first part of the test If the income from those financial assets is more than 50% of its gross income, it passes the second part of the test If a company passes both parts of the test, it is registered as an NBFC by the RBI.",

Engage a lawyer promptly to understand your legal position and prepare for any possible claims. Maintain a record of all relevant communications and events to defend yourself effectively if required.

We have been in a relationship for over a year, but due to a conflict, we stopped communicating in November. In the meantime, her parents proposed a marriage for her, and under pressure, she agreed. The engagement was carried out without my knowledge. I only learned about it a month later and subsequently spoke to her. She has since expressed to me that she is not interested in proceeding with the marriage and has communicated the same to her parents. However, her parents are unwilling to cancel the marriage, but she could not take a stand for me in front of her parents because they might emotionally black mail her, We are concerned about the legal and social consequences she might face if she cancels the marriage, including any potential liabilities or pressures from her family or the groom's side. She is a Christian and I'm a Hindu, Could you please advise us on the possible outcomes of canceling the marriage and recommend the best approach to handle this situation?",

            "Unfortunately, many women are suppressed and not allowed to marry as per their choice. I somehow don't agree with your statement, \"She could not take a stand for me in front of her parents because they might emotionally blackmail her,\" for the simple reason that it is an apprehension. I think your girlfriend can take a stand and communicate with the proposed groom & you can also talk to your parents and discuss with your girlfriend's parents and try to convince everybody. There are certainly many stigmas attached to inter-faith or intercaste marriages. The third person forcing a couple to enter a marriage or breakup is, in my opinion, a social evil & outdated mindset. Nobody can force anybody. Legal consequences: There are no specific legal consequences if you go against the family and marry. At the max, the dissenting family might not give you a share in their 'self acquired properties'. Social Consequences: As said above, you might face the stigma but it's out of anyone's control. We need not live our lives to satisfy others, especially when the subject is linked to personal choice and liberty. You both are adults. You can make your own decisions. You both can get married under the Special Marriage Act unless either of you want to convert your religion and get married as per the Hindu Marriage Act or the Christian Marriage Act. As a last resort, get married and seek police protection if you anticipate any threat.",
            "Dear Client, Engagements are not legally binding in India. This means that your girlfriend can cancel it without facing any legal consequences. However, she may face societal and emotional pressures from her family and the family of the groom, especially if some money has been spent or there had been a public announcement. The best way to combat this would be for her to have an open and respectful communication with her parents, focusing on her happiness and the importance of her consent in marriage. An elder or a family member or even a counselor whom your girlfriend can trust can help in discussing these matters. Thus, it is rare that the family of the groom would take legal action unless they could show either financial or emotional harm; nevertheless, it is sensible to stay on good terms and to maintain documentation of communication. If both of you decide to continue with the relationship, you can take into account the social and familial implications of an interfaith partnership. Hoping this answers your question. Please do not hesitate to pose more legal queries. Dear Client, If your girlfriend has rescinded the continuity of the marriage after her engagement, she needs to handle the situation very well, more so because there might be family pressure. Legally speaking, engagement is not a binding thing. That means she can turn down the marriage without any legal implications provided that no financial enticements nor binding agreements were made. If she cannot pursue her relationship with you due to family constraints, it would be better if you genuinely respected her position and DaR her happiness foremost. Especially, she should have a very open and honest communication with her family about it, possibly involving a well-meaning mediator or counselor. After all, an arrangement ought to be after her due comfort and independence without creating further war or distress. Hope this has helped you. You can definitely ask for any other legal queries.",
            "She is at liberty to call off the marriage she cannot be forced to marry against her wishes",
            "The girl can call off the engagement even at this stage. She can inform her parents as well as the would be bridegroom about her affairs with you and her intention to marry only you. Loving and marrying a person of different community or religion is not a social crime especially if she is stubborn about it then any false complaint that may be lodged by her parents will not be entertained or maintainable. You must assure her and give confidence to her and if possible you should convince your parents and ask them to talk to her parents and her too. As you both are major by age and are confident to live without depending on your parents for economic and other needs, you can take a firm decision to get married to her against all oppositions. You can take the support of your close friends and supporting relatives to somehow accomplish this feat.

Next Step to Get Possession Since Builder Has Not Complied with the Execution Notice File a Contempt Petition Against the Builder: Request a Recovery Certificate (RC) from RERA: Demand Police Assistance for Possession (if applicable): Drafting Service Offer: I can draft a detailed contempt petition or a recovery certificate request that ensures a faster response from RERA. 2.

Yes, You Must Respond to the DRT Case, but: Seek a Stay on DRT Proceedings: Key Tip: A strong response can delay the DRT proceedings, giving you time to enforce the RERA order.

Manipulating the Case to Your Advantage If you'd like me to take over, I can prepare and manage all the legal documents, including: This ensures all filings are error-free, properly formatted, and aligned with legal precedents. This also signals to the court and other parties that you're fully prepared to escalate the case if required. Practical Summary Enforce the RERA Order: Defend the DRT Case: Cost-Effective Representation: Would you like me to start drafting the Contempt Petition for RERA or the DRT Reply to help you move forward?",
            "Rera has directed the builder to hand over possession I want to know whether OC for the building is received ? It appears that you have to pay 20% from your pocket, 10% at time of booking and 10% at possession This means the balance 80% would have been paid by the bank under the subvention scheme to the builder on your behalf So you are indebted to the bank for that 80% regardless of the fact that you have not got the possession The subvention scheme is discontinued by RBI and is prohibited. There appears to be some RBI circular for that I would like to see your tripartite agreement to ascertain when your liability to repay the loan is triggered",

        "answers": [
            "In your case, since your divorce was granted in the USA, you will likely need to provide a legal document confirming your single status for your marriage in Vietnam. The Indian authorities may require proof of your divorce decree to validate your single status certificate, even though the divorce was granted in the USA. You can consider the following steps: Obtain an Apostille or Notarized Copy of the US Divorce Decree: Start by getting an apostille or notarized copy of your US divorce decree. This will serve as a certified translation of the divorce document, making it acceptable under international law. You may also have the document translated into English if required by Vietnamese authorities. Single Status Certificate from India: In India, you can apply for a Single Status Certificate from the relevant authority (usually the SDM or Notary). The Indian authorities may accept your US divorce decree as proof of divorce, especially if it is apostilled or notarized. You can clarify the issue with the relevant authority before proceeding with the process to confirm if they will accept the US divorce decree or if you will need to go through additional steps. Consult the Vietnamese Embassy or Consulate: It's important to check with the Vietnamese embassy or consulate about their specific requirements for a single status certificate. They may allow you to submit the US divorce decree or provide guidance on the acceptable documentation for this purpose. In case the authorities insist on an Indian divorce decree, you may need to file a petition for divorce in India. However, this is typically a lengthy and tedious process, and it might not be necessary if your US divorce decree is validated through apostille or notarization. If you face difficulties in the process, seeking assistance from a legal expert in both Indian and Vietnamese law can help streamline the procedure.

Having dealt with thousands of such cases of foreign divorce, I see no reason why the US decree passed by the competent court in USA will not be accepted in Vietnam.",

            "To get a single status certificate for marriage in Vietnam: Validate U.S. Divorce in India: File a petition in an Indian family court to validate the U.S. divorce decree under Section 13 CPC. This ensures it’s legally recognized in India. Alternative: If validation isn’t practical, file for a fresh divorce in India. This may be challenging if you’re not in touch with your ex-wife. Single Status Certificate: Prepare an affidavit declaring your single status, referencing the U.S. divorce. Notarize it and get it attested by the SDM and MEA, though they may ask for an Indian decree. Recommendation: Validate the divorce in India to avoid rejection during attestation.

I am an ex-defence Officer and joined this PSU on contract basis in 2016 executive Cadre in Grade VI. In 2023, there was an open competition for 12 permanent posts, 6 in Grade VI and 6 in Grade IV all for same cadre and only serving/ retired IAF officers can apply. I successfully competed and selected one of 06 Grade VI officers. I joined on 24 May 23 and I have 08+ continuous service till date. I had same eligibility, same selection process, same work with no concession. In 2016 I was fixed at minimum of scale at 80,000 (against my last drawn pay of Rs. 1,40,000) and reached 95,600 just before re-appointment. However, my pay was refixed again back to 80000 on re-appointment and assured refixation shortly as per company rules. I requested that my pay be retained at atleast 95,600 as I was from the same company, which was not agreed to. I expected that my pay will be re-fixed to last drawn pay as other 05 officers from Defence Services. Hence I applied or refixation of my last drawn pay. All 6 of us receive our respective pension. I am the seniormost among 12 officers in present company. Whereas, pay fixation of all 11 officers were completed within 6 months and they were fixed at their last drawn pay (1,80,000 for Grade VI and 1,40,000 for Grade IV). I expected that I too be fixed at my last drawn pay of 1,40,000 like my peers and even previously retired defence officers were fixed at their respective last drawn pay. However, after nearly 22 months of agonising wait, I was fixed at my pre-contract pay of 96,000. More shocking was that, even for releasing that, they put inhuman condition of getting my DA on pension be stopped. Although all my peers in grade VI also receive pension, no such condition was placed to them. It is a brazen denial of fundamental rights in 3 aspects. 1. Discriminative pay fixation methodology vis-av-vis peers 2 Being paid significantly less than juniors 2 level below me 3. Denying pay fixation methodology extended to all retired officers in the past. The reason given by HR for this disparity is that “All reemployed pensioners will be fixed at minimum of pay”. I protested that how my peers in Grade VI, who are also pensioners, were given their last pay. Illogical and arbitrary reasons were given. But, pay fixation at 96000 was badly required for me as I was badly in debt and they are refusing release that pay, by putting impossible condition of getting my DA in pension is stopped, whereas no other defence officers were asked so. As per GoI policy, DA in pension is admissible as long as last pay is not protected. No such rule is there either at company or in GoI and it is done by highest authority in HR (Director (HR)) who is the CFA. I am totally upset with Director (HR), who took law in his hands, forcing me to forego DA which I am duly entitled to and financially choking unsuspecting hapless employee, thus depriving his right to live etc. Also I want to file a suit against my company for denial of fundamental right",

Please provide me with the better solution",
        "answers": [
            "Yes it may affect a little but resignation is not a solution. Resignation will prove that you are guiilty. They can’t terminate you citing above reasons",
            "it is better to resign before your dismissed from service Your dismissal from service would affect your future employment prospects",

If getting an appointment in future on the basis of the experience of this employment, this will reflect in the background verification report. Therefore you can take a decision accordingly.",
            "Termination of contract on any grounds will not have any impact on any fresh contract or any future employment. Implication of contract ends with discharge of contract by rescind in any manner. Only if employment is permanent it will bar from future employment. But it safe to resign with honour.",

Impact of Termination on Future Recruitment Opportunities: 2. Resignation vs. Termination: 3. Recommended Course of Action: 4. If Resignation Is Considered: 5. Future Employment: It’s better to challenge retaliatory actions legally to protect your rights and prevent further victimisation. Resignation should only be a last resort after consulting with a lawyer and ensuring your professional reputation is safeguarded."

Their Regional Sales Manager said they will supply the products directly from their factory, from the same batch. He said that the company will communicate through email for the following transactions: They want me to pay the amount to their dealer's account (NR Enterprises, RR Nagar, Bangalore) before they dispatch the materials. The dealer will prepare the E-way bill. The materials will be delivered after a week straight from the factory in Hyderabad. After delivery of the materials, the dealer will come home to give us the invoice, which will be from NR Enterprises. The company's name will not appear in the financial transactions. 1. Please advise how to ensure that the company, Star Technologies, delivers the material to us, through their dealer NR Enterprises, after we have made the payment, without cheating us in this process. Star Technologies are offering a 7-year performance warranty for their products. The warranty certificate will mention only product replacement. 2. After the waterproofing material is applied on the exterior walls of our house, is this warranty certificate sufficient to ensure that Star Technologies will pay for the material and labour necessary to do any repairs that occur during the warranty period? 3. What grievance redressal avenues do we have in case the company defaults on delivery of materials or in honouring the performance contract?",

If anything goes wrong due to his fault, he will claim the product is not used as per procedure. Ascertain the procedure through written instruction. Better to have a tripartite against with supplier of contractor with clause that contractor observe exact procedure since he is a party to contract and provided by supplier. There is precautionary mechanism before payment. It is only after defects in product or deficiency in service you can successfully approach District Consumer Commission under new Consumer Protection Act, 2019."

            "There's no provision in law to get any restrain order in this regard. You can ignore seeing them or talking to them either personally or in social gatherings. Their marriage falling under sapinda is no doubt invalid but how can you rectify this error.",
            "Under Hindu law, the marriage of cousins (where the bride’s mother and the groom’s mother are sisters) may be valid or invalid depending on the customs and practices followed by your community. If such marriages are permissible under your community’s customs, they cannot be challenged solely on the grounds of disapproval or embarrassment. As for obtaining a restraining order, courts typically intervene only when there is a clear violation of legal rights or a significant threat to life, safety, or property. Embarrassment or discomfort, no matter how genuine, is unlikely to be sufficient grounds for such an order. However, if the couple's actions constitute harassment, cause mental trauma to the elderly parents, or create a public nuisance, you may file a civil suit for an injunction to restrain specific conduct, such as attending family functions or attempting reconciliation. Additionally, preventing someone from buying property near a residence or restricting their movement without lawful grounds would likely not be entertained by the court, as it could infringe upon their legal rights. It is recommended to approach a lawyer with detailed facts to evaluate whether specific actions of the couple could qualify as harassment or nuisance under the law and to proceed accordingly. Thanks and Regards, Advocate Aman Verma Legal Corridor",
            "Their marriage is invalid under Hindu Marriage Act, parties being within prohibited relationship and sapindas to each other. Any one can file a petition in family Court and get the marriage declared invalid. But Court cannot pass any restrain order you are asking for."

The construction was done as some of the Management association members are biased but the move is opposed by majority of residents. Need help if BDA can issue a notice to association to dismantle the structure",

            "File complaint with BDA regarding unauthorised construction done in amenity land file an RTI application if no action is taken on your complaint You can also take legal proceedings for demolition of unauthorised construction",
            "If your apartment management association has constructed a semi-permanent structure on Civic Amenity (CA) land that is still under the jurisdiction of the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), there are definite legal implications. Here’s how you can proceed to potentially address this issue: Understanding BDA's Role: The BDA has the authority to regulate constructions and ensure land use as per the designated plans. Any unauthorized construction on CA land is likely a violation of these plans. Filing a Complaint: Residents who oppose the construction can file a formal complaint with the BDA. The complaint should detail the nature of the construction, its location, and how it violates BDA regulations or land use plans. BDA Inspection and Notice: Upon receiving a complaint, the BDA is likely to conduct an inspection. If the construction is found to be unauthorized, the BDA can issue a notice to the association directing them to dismantle the structure. Gathering Support: Since the move is opposed by the majority of residents, it would be beneficial to gather as many signatures as possible to support the complaint. This shows a unified stance from the community, which can have a stronger impact. Legal Advice: It may also be advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in property or municipal law. They can provide guidance on the legal steps you can take and help draft the complaint to the BDA. Association Meeting: Organize a formal meeting with the management association to discuss the issue and the community's opposition to the construction. Presenting a formal request from the residents for the dismantling of the structure during this meeting might also pressure the management to act responsibly. By following these steps, you can initiate action to address the unauthorized construction effectively, leveraging both the authority of the BDA and the collective voice of the residents.

            "Capital gains from property received by gift are calculated based on the cost of acquisition by the previous owner, as per Section 49(1) of the Income Tax Act. 2) The holding period of the previous owner is also considered when determining whether the gain is short-term or long-term. 3) it would attract long term capital gains tax 4) she can reinvest capital gains in purchase of another property within period of 2 years",
            "Your mother-in-law may be liable for capital gains tax if she decides to sell the property, as the sale of property typically triggers tax implications. The capital gains tax depends on whether the property is considered a short-term or long-term capital asset. Since the property was transferred to her less than two years ago, it will be considered a short-term capital asset. In such cases, the capital gain is calculated based on the difference between the sale price and the cost of acquisition (which would be the cost at the time of the gift, i.e., the value of the property when her brother acquired it—₹5 lakh). The capital gains will be taxed at a rate of 15% for short-term capital gains under Section 111A of the Income Tax Act. If she reinvests the proceeds in another property, she may be eligible for exemptions under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act, where the capital gains are exempted if the entire amount is reinvested in the purchase or construction of a new residential property. This exemption is subject to the amount of capital gains, and the reinvestment should be done within a specified time frame (usually one year from the sale or within two years for purchase or three years for construction). Even if she doesn't have any other source of income, she will still need to pay taxes on the capital gains unless she qualifies for exemptions by reinvesting the proceeds. Additionally, old age does not provide any exemption for capital gains tax. However, senior citizens may benefit from a higher exemption limit in other income tax provisions, but that does not directly apply to capital gains tax in this scenario. It's recommended that she consult a tax professional or a lawyer to evaluate her specific case in detail, including the reinvestment options available to her, as tax laws can be complex. Thanks and Regards, Advocate Aman Verma, Legal Corridor.",
            "As the property is held for less than 36 months short term capital gain tax is applicable. Capital gain earned will be added to her income and than tax will be calculated on the tax bracker in she falls. Under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act she is entitled to tax exemption on profit earned if that entire profit amount is used to buy another house. She can buy a new house within 2 years from the date of sale of his previous property or construct a new house within 3 years from the date of sale. Under Section 54 EC she is entitled for tax exemption if the entire capital profit is invested in bonds issued by NHAI that is National Highway Authority of India or REC which is Rural Electrification Corporation. There is a limit to exemption under Section 54 EC and is Rs.50 lakh. In case she can’t find the right property to buy and is unable to come up with a concrete plan in 2-3 years, she still can save tax on the capital profit earned. This can be achieved by investing gains in the Capital Gains Accounts Scheme (CGAS) in any public sector bank. This amount can then be claimed for tax exemption. However, she is required to invest this money within the period stated by the bank else the deposit is treated as capital gain and tax is deducted on it.",

Since your father is the only legal heir, he is entitled to inherit this property, but it remains ancestral in nature. Grandmother's 1 acre: This is self-acquired property, as your grandmother purchased it in 1997. Your father inherited this property solely from her, and it is considered his individual property.

Guna, a Hindu male, passed away in 2019, leaving behind his wife Jo, son Senthil, daughter Meena, and mother Poon as his Class I legal heirs. Guna did not leave a will, and his estate consists of self-acquired properties. Subsequently, Jo passed away in 2021 without executing a will. Jo also had self-acquired properties. In 2022, Meena initiated a partition suit against Poon (Defendant 1) and Senthil (Defendant 2) to claim the properties of both Guna and Jo (father and mother). Later, in September 2024, Poon also passed away intestate (without a will). Poon had other children, namely Raja and Shanthi, apart from Guna. Currently, Senthil and Meena are pursuing mediation through the court to resolve the partition dispute. The court has requested details of the legal representatives (LRs) of Poon. Lawyer’s Position: My lawyer advises against producing the legal heir certificate of Poon if the mediation is successful and the case is withdrawn. His argument is as follows: 1. Poon’s legal heirs (Raja and Shanthi) are not entitled to a share in Guna’s properties as poon died. 2. Once a mutual partition deed is registered between the Senthil and Meena, it cannot be challenged after one year by Poon legal heris Raja and Shanthi, 3. Even if Raja or Shanthi files a case later, Poon’s death excludes her heirs from claiming a share. Additionally, Poon’s legal heirs (Raja and Shanthi) are reportedly supporting Senthil . Questions: 1. Is it possible for Poon’s legal heirs (Raja or Shanthi) to cancel the partition deed? 2. After the partition deed, can Meena sell her share of the properties without requiring the consent or signatures of Raja and Shanthi? 3. If Senthil executes a release deed from Poon’s legal heirs after the partition deed, will it be legally valid? Then Is it required Meena to get release deed from Poon’s legal heirs (Raja or Shanthi)? 4. What are the potential positive and negative implications of following this route? 5. If Poon’s heirs later claim a share in Poon’s estate , could that affect the partition deed? 6. What steps should be taken to safeguard against future claims by Poon’s legal heirs after the partition deed is registered? 7.

The partition between Jo and Senthil will be restricted to their parents' estate only and cannot include any asset owned or inherited by Poon including her 25% share in Guna's estate. Even if it includes it will be voidable at the instance of Raj and Shanthi who are entitled to the estate of Poon including 25% share which Poon inherited from Guna's estate 2. Yes so long as such sale does not affect Poon's 25% share in Guna's estate 3. Depends in whose favour such release is done. If Senthil secures a release in his favour then obviously Meena cannot have any claim over it. If Poon's heirs release in favour of Senthil and Meena jointly then they would be entitled to their respective shares. 4. Cannot work legally in so far it includes Poon's 25% share in Guna's estate 5. The partition deed will be affected only insofar it seeks to deal with Poon's share in Guna's estate 6. What steps ? Meena and Senthil CANNOT deal with Poon's 25% share at all since they are not legally entitled to it. For doing an illegality there cannot be any 'steps' to safeguard against future claims by Raj and Shanthi. Their right in Poon's 25% share in Guna's estate is a subsisting right and so long as it subsist they can seek to work it up any time. Even the bar of limitation will not come in their way. Any transfer by Meena and Senthil of Poon's 25% share in Guna's estate will simply be void as Meena and Senthil would have no right or title in that share in the first place 7. Completely irrelevant and stupid question. Their right is a continuing and subsisting right. So they can work it up anytime. 8. Partition suit for what?? Meena cannot file any partition suit to claim any right in Poon's 25% share in Guna's estate as that share belongs to Raja and Shanthi and NOT Meena."

Willing to by a property in auction by Bank 1 but there is a second charge on the said property created by Bank 2 without having any property under possession or obtaining NOC from Bank 1.Now what could be my liability towards this second charge created by Bank 2 or how this second charge will be removed from property documents as the auction proceeds will not even cover the secured lenders(Bank 1) debt fully.",
        "answers": [
            "You are not liable to pay second charge dues 2) bank has to approach DRT for recovery of its dues 3) inform the second charge holder that property is being sold . 4) don’t purchase the property",
            "When purchasing a property through a bank auction where a second charge exists, your liability toward the second charge (Bank 2) depends on the extent of the property's sale proceeds and the terms of the auction. Typically, the first charge holder (Bank 1) will have priority in recovering its dues, and if the auction proceeds do not cover its debt fully, the second charge holder (Bank 2) may not receive any payment. However, the second charge remains recorded in property documents until the debt is formally settled or waived by Bank 2. To address this, you should: Review the Auction Terms: Ensure the auction terms specify the transfer of the property free of encumbrances, particularly any subordinate charges. Communicate with Bank 2: Seek clarity from Bank 2 on their willingness to release the second charge after the auction. A no-dues certificate or NOC from them will help clear the title. Conduct Due Diligence: Engage a legal professional to scrutinise the title and check for any potential complications arising from the second charge. Court-Ordered Sale Protection: If the sale is court-ordered, it may extinguish the second charge, but this should be verified explicitly. It is advisable to consult a legal expert to navigate this issue and ensure the title is cleared post-auction to avoid future disputes. Thanks and Regards, Advocate Aman Verma Legal Corridor",
            "It will not be your liability but the first bank liability as it has to provide you good title",
            "Dear Client, Your liability regarding the second charge created by Bank 2 depends on the auction terms. If the property is sold by Bank 1 \"free from encumbrances,\" it is the duty of Bank 1 to clear the second charge and transfer the property with a clean title. If the auction is on an \"as is where is\" basis, you could inherit the second charge and would have to negotiate with Bank 2 for its release or challenge its validity if created without Bank 1's consent. It is of utmost importance to do a proper title search and read the terms of the auction to know the extent of your risks. If Bank 2's second charge is subordinate and the proceeds of the auction are inadequate to pay Bank 1's dues, you may have legal remedies to wipe out the second charge to have a clear title. Tread with caution and seek the advice of a legal expert in this regard.",
            "Dear Client, In case the second charge created by Bank 2 is illegal, as you state, you maypurchase the property through the auction by Bank 1, after proper legal safeguards. Under the SARFAESI Act, the properties are usually sold \"free from encumbrances\", which means the first charge holder (Bank 1) should settle or clear any subordinate charges before transferring the title. If Bank 2's charge is indeed illegal and not validly registered or consented to by Bank 1, it may not legally bind you as the buyer. But the problems would still be there if Bank 2 were to challenge the auction or seek to enforce its second charge. To reduce the above risk, insist that the sale terms specifically provide that the property is sold \"free from encumbrances.\" Also carry due diligence and scrutinize all of the records from title verification down to legal verification for the invalidity of Bank 2's charge. I advise you consultwith a lawyer, who should haveexperience dealing with properties to monitor the sale, documentationprocess. If the title and the auction process are clean, you will not be liable to pay Bank 2 or address its charge. Proceed only after all ambiguities regarding the second charge are resolved to avoid legal entanglements."

        "full_text": "Can I file cheating case on my wife and in-laws under 420 IPC. Eight years ago, I was approached by a businessman with a marriage proposal for his adopted daughter. He mentioned that he did not have any biological children and had adopted a girl who was a dentist. He expressed that they were looking for a suitable alliance within the medical profession. During our discussions, he claimed to own multiple schools and colleges located in various towns. He assured me that after marriage, his daughter would take over the administration of these institutions, while her husband would help manage their future plans to establish hospitals. After several meetings with the businessman, I was convinced and agreed to the marriage. However, after our wedding, his behavior changed drastically. He started avoiding our calls and made excuses to escape meeting us. Surprisingly, during important occasions such as the delivery of our child and other family ceremonies, my wife's biological parents were the ones who were actively involved, not the businessman who claimed to have adopted her. Upon further investigation, I discovered that my wife had not been legally adopted as claimed by the businessman. Despite feeling deceived, I chose to accept this and continued with my marriage. Over time, I noticed that my wife's biological parents were excessively interfering in our marital life. Their behavior was rude and controlling, which led to frequent disputes between my wife and me. Adding to these issues, I discovered that my wife was misusing money and transferring significant amounts to her biological parents. This created further friction in our relationship. Their interference and her financial actions have severely impacted our marital harmony. I strongly suspect that her biological parents were the masterminds behind this entire conspiracy to deceive me into the marriage. Due to the irreparable differences arising from these issues, my wife and I are now living separately, and I have filed for divorce. Given the circumstances, I wish to know if I can file a cheating case under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the businessman, my wife, and her biological parents for deceiving me into agreeing to this marriage based on false claims. Their misrepresentation of facts has caused significant emotional, financial, and personal distress.

            "If your neighbor’s shed construction is affecting the aesthetics or view of your villa, you can take the following steps: Check Local Laws and Regulations: Verify with your local municipal authority or housing society if the shed complies with building codes or regulations, especially if there are restrictions on colors, structures, or alterations in shared wall scenarios. Approach the Housing Society/Association: If you live in a gated community or villament society, bring the issue to the attention of the Residents’ Welfare Association (RWA). They might have guidelines on maintaining uniform aesthetics and can mediate the dispute. Serve a Legal Notice: If informal discussions fail, you can issue a formal legal notice to your neighbor, requesting them to modify or remove the shed, citing the negative impact on your property’s view and value. File a Complaint: If the shed violates zoning or municipal guidelines, file a complaint with the local municipal authority or town planning department to initiate corrective action. Legal Action: As a last resort, you can file a civil suit claiming nuisance and seeking a court order for the removal or modification of the shed. Document the harm caused, such as reduced property value or loss of aesthetic harmony, to support your case. Maintain a calm and polite approach during interactions, as resolving such disputes amicably is always preferable. Thanks and Regards, Advocate Aman Verma Legal Corridor"

Under the Indian legal system, a father can file a petition under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, or approach the Family Court for visitation rights as well, citing that it is essential for a child to have a close bond with grandparents for his or her emotional and cultural growth. Now you are suggesting to accompany the child during such visits, this will make your case much stronger by showing that both the safety and comfort of the child are ensured. Before you file a court case, you can forward a legal notice to your wife, requesting her to be cooperative and suggesting a specified visitation schedule of more than 15 days of the year in the child's best interest. If this does not work out amicably, you can apply for a court order to formalize visitation rights.

        "full_text": "Closure of joint home loan after divorce. Hi, I had taken a joint home loan with my then-husband. At the time he fooled me into getting an over-draft type of a loan account. Then when we divorced he executed a gift deed to transfer the ownership of the property to me. Since the beginning I’ve been the only one paying for the loan. I recently found out that even after our divorce and signing the gift deed my ex husband withdrew almost 4.5L from the Joan loan account as this was an OD account. Now I’ve been running behind the bank to give me control of the account as it is wrong that I am the one paying the loan and I’m the sole owner of the property while the other person is still cheating me by secretly withdrawing money from the account. I have frozen the debit on the account but I need your guidance to close this chapter once n for all. I am even ready to close the loan account but the bank says they would need my ex husband’s approval to release the property papers. The bank manager even said that “the bank doesn’t care what is going on in the outside world, we have some rules to follow”. I’m completely broken on how in this age our banks are still following these kind of rules, they want me to reach out to my abusive and cheating ex-husband and ask his approval. My situation is really terrible as I am sure my ex-husband would definitely exploit this opportunity to extort more money from me as now I work abroad. Is there a way where I can close the loan and get my property papers based on my divorce decree and the gift deed. The gift deed clearly states that my ex-husband has no claim over the property.",

Attach the gift deed, divorce decree, and proof of sole loan repayments to substantiate your claim. Send a Legal Notice to the Bank: Engage a lawyer to issue a legal notice to the bank, demanding the release of property papers upon loan closure, citing your sole ownership and the bank's obligation to act within the bounds of law and fairness. Civil Suit for Declaration and Injunction: If the bank continues to insist on your ex-husband's approval, you can file a civil suit in India seeking: Police Complaint for Fraud: Given your ex-husband's unauthorized withdrawal from the overdraft account post-divorce, consider filing a police complaint for criminal breach of trust and cheating under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC. This may also provide leverage in resolving the matter. Closure of Loan Account: Work with the bank to close the account and settle the loan. If the bank persists in requiring your ex-husband’s consent, present the legal documents (gift deed, divorce decree) and escalate the matter to senior bank officials or the regulator. Seek Legal Representation in India: Since you are abroad, appoint a trusted lawyer in India to represent you and handle proceedings on your behalf.

Here's a general overview: *Possible actions:* 1. *Sending demand notices*: The society can send repeated demand notices to the defaulting owners, specifying the amount due and the deadline for payment. 2. *Filing a civil suit*: If the owner fails to pay, the society can file a civil suit in a local court to recover the dues. 3. *Applying for an injunction*: The society can seek an injunction to restrain the owner from selling or transferring the property until the dues are paid. 4. *Imposing penalties*: The society may impose penalties, such as late fees or interest, on the outstanding amount. *Maximum actions:* 1. *Attachment of property*: In extreme cases, the court may order the attachment of the owner's property to recover the dues. 2. *Sale of property*: If the owner still fails to pay, the court may order the sale of the property to satisfy the debt. *Cost involved:* 1. *Demand notices*: ₹500-₹2,000 (depending on the advocate's fees) 2. *Filing a civil suit*: ₹5,000-₹20,000 (depending on the court fees, advocate's fees, and other expenses) 3. *Injunction application*: ₹2,000-₹5,000 (depending on the court fees and advocate's fees) *Time taken to resolve:* 1. *Demand notices*: 1-3 months 2. *Filing a civil suit*: 6-18 months (depending on the court's workload and the complexity of the case) 3. *Injunction application*: 1-3 months Please note that these estimates are approximate and may vary depending on the specific circumstances and the efficiency of the legal system. As a non-defaulter owner, you may not be directly affected by the legal action. However, you may still incur additional costs, such as: 1. *Increased maintenance charges*: To cover the costs of pursuing legal action against defaulters. 2. *Special levies*: The society may impose special levies on all owners to cover the costs of legal action.",
            "Yes, a building or society association can take legal action against owners for non-payment of maintenance charges. Typically, the process begins with a demand notice sent to the defaulters, followed by a recovery suit filed under applicable laws, such as the Societies Act or Cooperative Societies Act. The association may also claim interest on the unpaid amount as per the society’s bylaws. If the default continues, a court order can enforce recovery, including attachment of property or assets, and in extreme cases, the court may allow auctioning the flat to recover dues. Some associations impose restrictions on access to non-essential facilities like clubhouses, but essential services such as water and electricity cannot be disconnected. Legal costs for such actions can vary, typically ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹1,00,000 or more, while resolution might take anywhere from 6 months to several years, depending on the case. For other members, such legal action could lead to increased financial burden due to legal expenses and delayed recovery of funds. To minimize costs and discord, the association can consider mediation or arbitration before resorting to litigation and ensure regular communication with members about dues and consequences of default."

        "full_text": "Office units purchased/possession done but registry pending and now builder in IBC. I had bought a couple of office units in late 2019 in resale on golf course extension gurgaon, original buyer had bought in 2009. Builder did the formal tranfer of units, took possession in 2020. I have rented out in 2022 & received rent for past 2 yrs. Builder had sent a letter to get the registry done but I forgot due to ignorance Now recently a got a letter from some IBC resolution professional that builder is insolvent and informing he has taken over day to day operations. He also wrote that all claims can be submitted via email Now issue is now that I have possession for 4+ yrs and paid everything in full, it is not like the builder owes me money. Whether I should file any claim or not ?? If I do file a claim will it means that the title of property is now disputed and will be resolved once the IBC process is done?",

            "Dear Client, as you have taken possession of the office units, paid full consideration, and have been utilizing the property for two years, your main worry would be the pending registry which leaves the legal title incomplete. Filing a claim with the resolution professional under IBC does not necessarily imply that the property title becomes disputed; it instead provides a safeguard to your interest during the insolvency process. You can file a claim notifying the resolution professional about your ownership and thus exercising your right to have the registry completed. In any event of resolution plan or liquidation, your position is protected, and it is taken into consideration. Consult a legal professional to file a petition if you need to enforce the completion of the registry for getting full legal title and thereby avoiding complications in the future. Filing of the claim would not impair your possession; however, it is mandatory to avoid loss of your rights. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",
            "- Since, you have already made complete amount of the said unit , then you should move an application before the IBC for informing the same and becoming a party in the said resolution. - Further, you can also issue a legal notice to the said builder for executing sale deed with the approval of the IBC.",
            "It appears that you have purchased the property but have not got the property registered by a sale deed on your name. May be because you wanted to avoid paying stamp duty that you didn't take care about registration of sale deed in your favour. Since the creditors have approached resolution professional and as your name appears in the list of creditors with RP you can make a claim for the money you have already paid to the builder. However, if there are possibilities for getting the property registered through the builder at a later stage (though the chances are dim), then you may decide otherwise but make sure your investment is safe and secure in either of the option."

        "full_text": "Roof and basement right of original landlord. Hello, TO SUMMARIZE MY QUERY, IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY MENTION IN ANY OF THE SALE DEED (OF ANY OF THE FLOOR OF A HOUSE) OF THE ROOF RIGHT OR THE RIGHT TO CONSTRUCT NEW BASEMENT (DURING RECONSTRUCTION), WILL THE RIGHT TO CONSTRUCT ABOVE THE ROOF AND/OR THE BASEMENT LIE WITH THE ORIGINAL LANDLORD OR WILL IT BE PROPORTIONATE. The same query is explained in a little more detail below In 2007 I inherited the ground floor of a house having a total of 4 floors. All of above floors were already sold off many years back. My sister being the original landlord. The second floor was sold off in 1988 and the top third floor was also purchased by the owner of the second floor in 1993. In both the cases there is no mention of any roof right in the sale deed whatsoever. Since it's a very old house, all the house owners are considering reconstructing the house. Currently no construction is permissible above Basement + stilt + 1 + 3 floors i.e 4 floors in our area. But still a very important question still remains that if and whenever in near or unforeseeable future if permission to construct above 4 floors is ever allowed then in absence of any mention of roof right in the sale agreement of any of the above floors who will have the right to construct if such a permission to construct becomes applicable. Secondly similarly if a basement is constructed during reconstruction then will the right be proportionate or will it be the right of the original landlord (in absence of mention of the basement in any of the above floor sales deed).",
        "answers": [
            "Original landlord has no roof rights. Any construction has to be done as per the sanction plans. Original landlord has no rights on the basement.",
            "In the absence of any specific agreement as to exclusive ownership, everything will be proportionate, including roof rights and basement rights .",
            "It’s proportionate and you need to follow all regulations",
            "Key Considerations: No Mention of Roof Rights: Basement Construction Rights: Reconstruction and Future Construction Rights: Legal Interpretation of Roof and Basement Rights: Roof Rights: Basement Rights: Proportional Ownership:",
            "To address your query regarding the right to construct above the roof and the right to construct a basement in the absence of any explicit mention in the sale deeds, here's a detailed breakdown: 1. Right to Construct Above the Roof: In the absence of any specific mention of roof rights in the sale deeds of the individual floors, typically, ownership of the roof would remain with the original landlord (your sister, in this case). However, it is important to consider the following: Nature of Roof Rights: If the sale deeds of the second and third floors (which were sold to the respective buyers) do not specifically mention roof rights, this usually means that the rights to the roof, including any future construction, remain with the owner of the ground floor or the original landlord. Proportional Rights: In some cases, even if there is no explicit mention, proportionality can be inferred. For example, if the ground floor owner decides to build additional floors above, the rights to the roof could potentially be shared with other owners on the basis of the area they own. However, in the absence of clear terms in the sale deed, such a right is typically assumed to lie with the original owner (in this case, your sister). This would depend on the local laws and regulations, as well as any agreements that may exist between the owners of the floors. Permission for Future Construction: If permission to construct above the 4th floor is granted in the future, and if there is no specific agreement in the sale deeds, the original owner (your sister) may have the right to apply for the construction or decide how the space above the 4th floor is used, unless the other floor owners jointly claim rights to it. 2. Right to Construct Basement: Proportionality: In the case of constructing a basement, the right would typically be proportional to the area owned by the respective floor owners, unless otherwise agreed upon in the sale deed. If the basement construction is not mentioned in any of the sale deeds, it would be treated as part of the overall common property and would be subject to decisions taken jointly by all the floor owners. Original Landlord's Rights: The original landlord (your sister) may have certain rights to the basement, particularly if the sale deeds do not specify the use of common areas or future constructions. However, if the owners of the other floors have been using the land together, they could argue for shared ownership of any new construction, including the basement. Legal Precedent: In general, in the absence of explicit rights in the sale deed, the right to construct would likely be subject to the joint consent of all floor owners. The original landlord may have a claim, but it would be proportional to the shares of the property. This would depend on how the land is jointly owned and local property laws. Recommendation: To avoid future disputes, it is advisable to have a legal agreement or amendment to the existing sale deeds to clearly specify the rights to the roof and basement. This will provide clarity on future construction rights, particularly if the laws change to allow construction above the 4th floor or the addition of a basement. It would be prudent to consult a property lawyer to clarify these issues and potentially draft an agreement that ensures all parties' interests are protected."

        "full_text": "My builder wrongfully cancelled my unit due to miscommunication. Hi, I would like to share few details about the case. To give a small background, i am a first-time home buyer. For each unit there is a dedicated CRM associated to handle any queries, reminders etc. During these 2 years these CRMs have been changed multiple times. Also I had only 2 demands left to fulfil for completion of my unit and there were certain discounts associated with these demands. In last week of September 2024, I got the 2nd last demand letter for which I raised the disbursement request via bank online portal but accidentally forgot that there were few adjustments to be made in this demand for which I met my designated CRM for the unit. They acknowledged that they forgot to adjust the discounts and asked me to cancel the existing disbursement and raise a new one after a new demand letter sent. This whole process was completed on November 28. During this process on the reference ticket I asked them about when will it get completed and the new demand letter, they mentioned that it is in progress and will let me know. I was not clarified and left unanswered about the new demand letter, so i assumed that it would automatically be given once the process is completed. Please note that being a first home buyer such questions are quite valid for me and I was expecting clarity about the next steps from builder's end. Between November 28 & 22nd December 2024, no one from the group including my so called dedicated CRM either chased me or established any communication with me for the payment reminder. Please note that the previous RM and collection agent used to do so(I have proof of everything). First they said I must have been chased or communicated about the reminders by team, when I showed them all proofs they admitted it person that the miscommunicated at first and not send any reminders while also remained clueless about how to revoke cancellation or if revoked then not give the discount on last disbursement due to their company policy. I would like to tell that I had no such intention of withholding money from them instead i raised the disbursement correctly at first time, it was me who initiated the process for adjustment when it should have been done by them in the first place and was only waiting to hear from them about the next steps. I feel mentally harassed by this group as it has affected my work and pretty much everything else. Because of such a poor communication and just for the amount of 6 lakh i was served with unit cancellation.

The subsequent order dated 19/06/2024 confirms that the impleadment of the auction purchaser was carried out that day. Therefore, the specific condition triggering the validity of the status quo order—completion of the amendment—was fulfilled on 19/06/2024. Thus, after 19/06/2024, the status quo order, as per its plain language, would no longer be effective. 2. Order Dated 09/08/2024 The order dated 09/08/2024 was passed not to continue the status quo but to address the non-compliance by the Respondent Bank with prior directions. Key points from the 09/08/2024 order: This order does not revive or revalidate the earlier status quo order; instead, it deals with procedural non-compliance by the Respondent Bank and ensures the matter is appropriately placed before the Presiding Officer. Conclusion If further clarity or relief is required, you can move an appropriate application before the Presiding Officer in the next hearing."

Out of the three, two of them have encroached the duct area by converting it into a storage room and then built safety doors to extend their apartment space and the third has taken up about 8-9 feet of the common space and built a large safety door and occupied the space. All of this was done in our absence in 2021 during the peak of the COVID pandemic while we were in another city during the lockdown. When a meeting was held within the housing society around the end of 2021 the committee mentioned that this construction was done without the permission of the society and the committee will not and cannot take any action and told us to take legal action against our neighbors at our end. My parents decided not persuade this matter further as getting into legal action will supposedly incur a lot of time as well as money. Also, during the meeting, the rationale provided by one of the neighbors was that there are other people in the building who had made this and then proceeded to shifting the blame onto us indicating that we are at fault for not allowing them to do so earlier. There were also health issues given by the neighbors as pigeons entered from the duct area and the occupied common area, which frankly makes no sense to us as the windows could have simply be kept closed for dealing with that or a net could have been put as well. Their accusation was we did not allow them to put the net (which isn't true as it was never discussed) which is why they did this. Personally, I am not satisfied with not taking any action and I do wish to take action against my neighbors against this illegal construction after a few years when I have more personal time. In the meantime I had some questions and would appreciate your insights on the same: 1.) Are the committee members of the housing society not allowed to take any action in this case? If so, then what is the point of even having a committee? I found this to be very strange 2.) If legal action is taken by us against our neighbors what is the duration taken to get the justice on this matter? Is it true that it will take several years and alot of money? What would be the range in terms of the costs incurred if legal action is considered? 3.) Are there alternatives to legal action in this case, such as, writing to the fire department, electrical department, municipal committee (BMC) or any other legal body for demolition of these illegal construction? 4.) Is there a set time period by which action is required to be taken after which it is too late? Currently we are too busy with our professional lives to be involved into this matter and would like to take this matter up a few years from now when we are in a better financial and professional position.

Married for 10 years. My child is with British passport, living with me and husband in the UK . Last 5 years have been mentally straining for me , as husband is living a room mate life style.he asked for separation / divorce , to my shock . I was ready to patch up but he wasn’t , so unwillingly I was forced to live a room mate life style. I’m frustrated a lot , now I finally am ready to move out and live a separate life with daughter . But , he is angry I took the decision myself , threatening and forcing me to live in the same house . He is not staying at the home for most of the nights in the week or coming home very late , he just needs a familial residence arrangement and making me stay in the same house he can force me to pay half rent and he can keep fooling the kid that he is fully functional as a father but he is not . I’m doing everything from morning till night , managing all child and my expenses from my salary . He pays rent for the house. I’m ok to bear it by moving out , on top of other expenses , instead of the silent isolation he is forcing on me . I want to go away from him with no contact . With this person , I feel like being mentally bullied always because of the interactions needed for joint parenting or visitations .. I don’t want to have that pain.. he is any ways not home most of the nights in the week leaving home by 7.30 am in the morning just after an hour of waking up . So he hardly spends an hour with the kid . He takes no other responsibilities. So , living out with no contact with him doesn’t make a difference . He is agitated only Becuase he can no longer force me to be in the same house, letting me do all but kid will not know and the society or family will not know he wasn’t playing part at all .

If you believe that there has been judicial misconduct or bias due to the involvement of the principal district court judge's family, you may consider lodging a complaint with the High Court. Consult with your advocate to prepare a detailed complaint outlining the alleged misconduct and providing supporting evidence. Your advocate should explore options for seeking emergency relief, such as filing for a stay order or injunction to halt further construction pending the resolution of the dispute. Exercise caution in all interactions and communications, avoiding any actions that could be perceived as confrontational or aggressive. Focus on presenting a strong legal case based on facts and evidence.",

People rely on hearsay advises. High court is not trial court and high court donot entertain complaint cases as other trial court do. Since judge is involved so situation is required to be handled tactfully. You have badly handled the issue which resulted into worsening the situation. If police is not registering FIR then you can file complaint case also under section 156 (3) cr.p.c. and can also file WRIT in high court. For rest you may consult individually."

STATE OF KARNATAKA, REP BY ITS PRINCIPAL SECRETARY, REVENUE DEPARTMENT, M.S.BUILDING, BENGALURU-560 001 AND OTHERS. ORDER 1. In this writ petition, petitioner is challenging the order dated 05.07.2016 passed by respondent No.3 Tahsildar,-Davangere.By the said order, the Tahsildar, in exercise of powers under Section 95 of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 (for short, ' the Act '), has directed that the construction made by petitioner herein of a building in the lands bearing R.S.No.58 measuring 3 acres 12 guntas and R.S.No.59/P2-P1 measuring 2 acres 6 guntas situated in Avaragere Village, Kasaba Hobli, Davangere Taluk, shall be demolished after taking necessary approval from the Deputy Commissioner, Davangere District.It is further directed that expenses to be incurred for removal of the structure shall be recovered from the petitioner after obtaining necessary permission from the Deputy Commissioner, Davangere.The Tahsildar has also directed both parties to maintain status-quo regarding the property in question till the dispute with regard to their title and interest over the property in question was decided by the Civil Court. 2. Facts, as narrated in the memorandum of writ petition, disclose that petitioner claims to be the owner in possession and enjoyment of the property in question.He has constructed a building in a portion of agricultural lands allegedly as a farm house.The Tahsildar issued notice dated 17.08.2015 to the petitioner alleging that he had violated the provisions of Section 95 ( 2) of the Act because construction put up by him was not of a farm house, but of a huge building for purposes other than agriculture. 3. An order had been passed on 01.09.2015 in similar terms as has been done now under the impugned order.The same was challenged before this Court in W.P.Nos.41416/2015 & 41784/2015.This Court disposed of the said writ petitions on 01.10.2015 observing that petitioner had to prefer an appeal under Section 49 of the Act. W.A.Nos.4356/2015 & 4524/2015 were filed against the same.The Division Bench of this Court set aside the order passed by the Tahsildar and remitted the matter to the Tahsildar for consideration afresh and directed the parties to maintain status-quo with regard to change in the nature and character of the property in dispute till the matter was considered by the Tahsildar. The Tahsildar was directed not to prevent the petitioner from entering into the farm house already constructed on the land.This is how the Tahsidlar has considered the matter afresh and has passed the impugned order. 4. As per the findings recorded by the Tahsildar, although petitioner had asserted before him that construction put up in the land in question was that of a farm house, report secured by the Tahsidlar from different authorities such as the Assistant Executive Engineer, Public Works Department and the Assistant Director of Agriculture, Department of Agriculture disclosed that size of the construction was 150 X 50 sq.mtrs.and the approximate cost of construction was around rupees twenty two lakhs and therefore, such a building could not have been constructed in the agricultural land and hence, it had to be regarded as illegal construction put up without getting the land converted as required under Section 95 of the Act. 5. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner contends that the Tahsildar obtained report from the Public Works Department and Department of Agriculture behind the back of the petitioner and none of the reports relied upon were furnished to the petitioner to have his say in the matter. He further points out that merely because construction was relatively huge, it could not be contended that it ceased to be a farm house. 6. It is contended that as long as the construction put up is for the purpose of the farmer to enable him to carry on his agricultural activities in the farm land, no matter whether it is a smaller construction or bigger one, it does not lose the characteristic feature of a farm house. 7. Sri S.V.Angadi, learned counsel appearing for impleading applicant in I.A.1/2016 submits that petitioner has been illegally enjoying the property without parting with the requisite share which the impleading applicant is legally entitled as per the judgment and decree passed by the Civil Court.He submits that petitioner is unjustly enriching himself by enjoying the properties including the subject lands with utter disregard to the judgment rendered by the Civil Court. 8. Learned Additional Government Advocate points out that as per Section 95 ( 1) of the Act, erection of building for better cultivation of the agricultural land or for its more convenient use, though permissible, in terms of the proviso to sub-section. (1) of Section 95 of the Act and the explanation appended thereto, the farm building or farm house, so erected shall not be more than 10% of his holding and that farm house or farm building means a house attached to a farm and construction in a portion of agricultural land, used for the residence of the agriculturist or used for the purpose of keeping agricultural equipments and tethering cattle. The house shall be used by farmer for his own use and it shall not be let out for commercial activities to any individual or agency. 9. In the light of the above, I have examined the contentions urged by all the parties and also the entire matter in detail. Sub-section ( 1) of Section 95 of the Act which is relevant for the present purpose can be usefully extracted as under: \" Subject to any law for the time being in force regarding erection of buildings or construction of wells or tanks, an occupant of land assessed or held for the purpose of agriculture is entitled by himself, his servants, tenants, agents, or other legal representatives, to erect farm buildings, construct wells or tanks, or make any other improvements thereon for the better cultivation of the land or its more convenient use for the purpose aforesaid: Provided that the farm Building or farm House so erected shall not be more than ten per cent of his holding subject to maximum of such extent of land as may be prescribed. \" 10. Section 96 of the Act provides for imposition of penalty for using agricultural land for other purposes without permission. Sub-section ( 1) of Section 96 of the Act reads as under: \" If any land assessed or held for the purpose of agriculture be diverted or used for any other purpose without the permission of the Deputy Commissioner, or before the expiry of the period prescribed in sub-section ( 5) of Section 95, the Deputy Commissioner may summarily evict the occupant and the person responsible for the diversion from the land so diverted and any building or other construction erected thereon shall also, if not removed after such written notice as the Deputy Commissioner may deem reasonable, be liable for forfeiture or to summary removal. The occupant and the person responsible for the diversion shall also be liable to pay, such penalty not exceeding one thousand rupees as the Deputy Commissioner may, subject to the rules made by the State Government in this behalf, direct. \" Rule 107- A of the Karnataka Land Revenue Rules, 1966 makes provision for payment of amount for compounding, in case of diversion of agricultural lands for non-agricultural use. 11. It is thus clear that an agriculturist can erect building in his agricultural land for its more convenient use or better cultivation, provided such farm building or farm house so erected is not more than 10% of his holding subject to maximum of such extent of land as may be prescribed. No Rule prescribing any maximum extent of land on which such building can be erected is brought to the notice of the Court. Therefore, proviso which says that the farm building or farm house so erected shall not be more than 10% of his holding has to be kept in mind while examining whether the house constructed is in the nature of a farm house or it loses its characteristic feature of a farm house. In other words, if the farmer has got 10 acres of land, he cannot be found fault with for putting up construction utilizing a bigger area in his agricultural land, say up to 1 acre provided he uses such construction for his own residence for the purpose of agricultural operations, tethering of cattle or for storing agricultural implements or products including for residence of himself and his family members, his servants and dependents. 12. If the agricultural land is so required to be used for erecting a farm house or farm building, then the agriculturist is not required to file an application seeking conversion of land as contemplated under sub- section ( 2) of Section 95. 13. In the instant case, the Tahsildar has proceeded on the basis of the report obtained from the Public Works Department and Department of Agriculture wherein it has been allegedly stated that petitioner had constructed a huge building by spending about rupees twenty two lakhs apparently for subjecting it to commercial use and therefore, it could not be regarded as a farm house. This finding recorded by the Tahsildar is not preceded by a fair and reasonable opportunity given to the petitioner by supplying copies of the reports obtained from the Assistant Executive Engineer of Public Works Department and Assistant Director of Agriculture of Agriculture Department. It is well established that if a quasi judicial authority wants to place reliance on any report which is adverse to the interest of the petitioner, then the affected person (petitioner herein) shall be furnished with copies of such reports and shall be provided an opportunity to rebut the contents thereof. Such a procedure has not been followed in the instant case. 14. Merely because the construction put up is a bigger one, it cannot be held that the construction loses the characteristic of a farm building unless it falls within the mischief of proviso to sub-section ( 1) of Section 95 of the Act which states that such farm building or farm house erected shall not be more than 10% of his holding or that it does not satisfy the explanation appended to sub-section ( 1) of Section 95 of the Act which states that farm building or a farm house means a house attached to a farm and construction made in a portion of agricultural land, used for the residence of the agriculturist or used for the purpose of keeping agricultural equipments and tethering cattle or that the house shall be used by farmer for his own use and shall not be let out for commercial activities to any individual or agency. 15. There is no finding recorded in the instant case that construction put up has been let out either for commercial use to any other person or agency. In such circumstances, the Tahsildar was not right and justified in making an inference based on the structure put up that as the building was bigger one, it could not be regarded as a farm house/building. In addition, the Tahsildar was not right and justified in directing the parties to maintain status-quo till disposal of the civil suit. It is for the authorities to work out their remedies in the pending civil suit and not for the Tahsildar to pass an order directing the parties to maintain status-quo during the pendency of the civil suit. 16. In the instant case, it is pointed out that a decree has been passed declaring the right of the impleading applicant in the family properties and for allotment of her share as back as in the year 1972.It is also pointed out by Sri Angadi, learned counsel appearing for the impleading applicant that till today impleading applicant has not been able to secure the fruits of the decree. Learned counsel for the petitioner points out that appeal filed against the decree is pending before this Court.If that is so, both parties are well advised to expedite the said appeal or request the Court to refer the matter for mediation so that long standing litigation c",

We married in April 2022 and filed for mutual consent divorce in July 2023. Now she is mentally torturing and blackmailing me. A little background. She was working abroad in gulf before we met in matrimony site and got married. She was having a close friendship with a male colleague. I once found him hugging her when I was not present and had warned her that I will divorce her. This happened same year of marriage. Then in 2023, I found that she went to Bali for a week in her vacation(She was in airline ground services). But it was only few days after going there that I found that she had gone to Bali with that same male colleague. I was working in ship at that time and I didn't have access to internet and only had basic business email facility. I tried hardest to get to tell me the truth honestly but she lied profusely , even swearing in the name of my marriage, her mother and God and saying she went to Bali alone. After two weeks I got internet and I found her messages to him in instagram(I had her login details saved in my tablet). There were signs of an emotional relationship between the two of them which gets stronger once I started confronting her to tell the complete truth with the little proof I had. Finally I decided I cannot take her lies after going through mental torture. I told her I'll file mutual divorce and asked her to home sign. Before that I had also given her one chance to fly to my home within one day forgetting all her job. But she didn't. She finally submitted her divorce papers listening to her mother and sister. I decided to give her a chance by bringing her to my home. But fights soon ensued and she started defending herself. She left to her mother's home in a week. By this time I was mentality exhausted. And I told her to either come home immediately or divorce me as I don't trust her staying in her mother's home and being faithful to me. Eventually she agreed to sign for mutual divorce. But later had second thoughts after being in her home jobless for few weeks. Following this she started begging me on daily basis in my vacation to take her back home. I refused profusely but she kept emotionally manipulating me and gaining sympathy saying she has no father and she trusted me completely. Finally I brought her home just 2 days before going back to ship. She stayed in my home for almost 6 months. When I came back from ship in sep 2024, our mutual divorce case had gone to conciliation stage. After I came from ship.(contd)",

We are in the process of selling property in [Location], but the registrar has stated that an Aadhaar card is mandatory for completing the transaction.

            "Dear Client, In your case it is possible that you may have to pay maintenance during the Domestic Violence (DV) proceedings though your wife may be levelling baseless allegations. Your wife will be able to claim from your income of ₹ 90,000 or any reasonable amount minus the medical bills. While the DV case might be false, and may change maintenance obligations if proven so, it does not necessarily remove you from paying unless a court allows it to do so. As for making home dues, since your wife is capable of earning but decide not to work then this too can be taken to court to try and reduce her maintenance claim. Furthermore, an act can be an act of cruelty in terms of Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 where false allegations have been made. Once you prove that the allegations made by her are false you can file a defamation case under section 354 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (previously, Section 499 IPC) or can lodge a complaint under section 246 of BNS (Previously, Section 211 of IPC) for filing a false case.

As per Supreme Court judgment, wife is expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter. - Further, the court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of “cruelty” after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws. - Further, If wife is not supporting her husband for the enjoyment of life and denying relation, then the husband can get divorce after filing a divorce petition before the court on this ground. 5.

            "If it’s comes under land acquisition then you will get appropriate compensation as per the Act",
            "In your situation, where a 133KV cable and tower have been plotted on your land for over 15 years, and you haven't been compensated, there are several legal avenues you can explore to seek compensation and remedy the loss of land value. Here’s an analysis based on the facts you provided: 1. Eligibility for Compensation: Land Acquisition Laws: Typically, when government or private entities (like power distribution companies) use land for laying cables, towers, or other infrastructure, they need to either acquire the land or compensate the landowner. If the use of the land was without proper acquisition or compensation, you could potentially seek compensation under relevant laws, such as the Land Acquisition Act or the Electricity Act. Prescription Period: While compensation claims generally need to be filed within a certain time frame (typically 3 to 5 years in many cases), certain exceptions can apply. Since this is a long-standing issue (15 years), it may be difficult to claim compensation under regular statutes unless it can be shown that: If there was no formal acquisition process followed at the time the cable and tower were placed, and you were not compensated for the land used, you might still have the right to seek compensation or initiate legal proceedings. 2. Steps for Seeking Compensation: Review the Agreement or Consent (if any): If there was any agreement (written or verbal) between you and the authorities or company regarding the land usage, it would be essential to review that. This document could provide grounds for a claim. File a Claim for Compensation: If no formal compensation was offered or made, you can file a formal complaint with the Electricity Regulatory Commission or the relevant authority responsible for the installation of the cable and tower (such as the electricity board or municipal corporation). You may also consider seeking compensation for loss of land value or damages. Pursue Legal Action in Court: If the authority refuses to provide compensation, you could file a suit in the appropriate civil court for compensation under the provisions of the Electricity Act (specifically Section 67 of the Act for laying cables) or even under the Land Acquisition Act if it was a case of acquisition without compensation. Public Interest Litigation (if applicable): If the authority is misusing public land or if the matter affects public interest, you might also approach the High Court for a writ petition or Public Interest Litigation (PIL). 3. Land Use and Development Issues: Land Not Being Counted in Colony Development: If the land is being underutilized or considered unavailable for development (for example, for roads or parks) due to the presence of the cable and tower, this might constitute an issue of non-use or restriction placed by the authorities without proper justification. Request for Land Rectification or Relocation: You may want to request the authorities to either: Land Use Permits or Zoning Considerations: You can file a representation with the local municipal corporation or zoning authorities, requesting that the land be formally cleared for development. If the authorities are preventing development due to the cable and tower, there may be room to request a change in zoning or an exemption from certain regulations for the land. 4. Practical Steps to Take: Consult a Property Lawyer: It would be prudent to consult with a property or land acquisition lawyer who can assess the specifics of your case and advise on the best course of action for claiming compensation, removing the restrictions on your land, and preventing further losses. Send a Legal Notice: If the authorities have been unresponsive or are refusing to compensate you for the land use, you can send a legal notice demanding compensation and/or removal of the cable and tower. File a Case for Injunction: If you are unable to prevent the authorities from continuing to block your land development, you can file a case seeking an injunction to prevent them from wasting or misusing the land. Conclusion: You may still be eligible to seek compensation for the use of your land for the cable and tower, despite the long period that has passed, depending on the specific circumstances. Additionally, you can explore options for challenging the continued blockage of your land use for colony development. It is advisable to consult with a qualified lawyer specializing in property law or land acquisition to help you understand your legal rights, options for compensation, and remedies for land use issues.

        "full_text": "Khulanama validation. Is my Khulanama valid under Muslim law and is it legal? It is sent by my ex-wife, who lives in Delhi, via registered post, as I live in Mumbai. No local authority, like Darul Qaza, Jamaat, or a registered Kazi, was involved. However, two witnesses from both sides signed the document, but it is not notarised on any bond. Can this Khulanama be challenged in the future, and does it have any legal impact on me? Someone also suggested me to approach local Kazi to get it validated. Please suggest.",
        "answers": [
            "Legally speaking there is no necessity for the Darul Qaza or the Jamaat to certify the Khulanama, because they are not the legal authority to grant divorce under Muslim personal law. The Personal law is very clear that the khulanama or talaq becomes valid with anyone witnessing it. If you still insist on further legal compliance in this regard, you may have to file a civil suit for declaration to declare the dissolution of your marriage by Khulanama is valid. No doubt this divorce decree/judgment would be pertinent if you want to remove your spouse name from your passport and not otherwise. Therefore this Khulanama declaration with two witnesses attesting the same is a legally valid divorce as per Muslim personal law in general law too.",
            "You should register the khula Nama 2) you can file petition for declaration that marriage is dissolved by khula Nama",
            "khula requires a formal procedure. It has to be certified by office of local qazaath attested by wakf board. Procedure for valid khula/divorce is laid down by State government. Any khula ignoring such procedure is invalid.",
            "You need to file petition in family court for the validation process of khulanama as per shariat Act",
            "Under Muslim personal law, a Khulānamā (divorce by mutual consent initiated by the wife) can be valid, but there are certain requirements and nuances involved in its legal validity and enforceability. Here’s an analysis based on the details you have provided: 1. Validity of Khulanama Without Darul Qaza, Jamaat, or Kazi Involvement: Role of Darul Qaza, Jamaat, or Kazi: While the involvement of a Darul Qaza, Jamaat, or a Kazi is not mandatory for a Khulā under Muslim law, it is advisable to have a formal and legal process to ensure the document's validity. A Kazi is generally considered an authoritative figure who can officiate and record the Khulā, ensuring both parties understand the terms and conditions. Witnesses: The requirement of two witnesses from both parties is generally enough to validate the Khulā, assuming that both parties agree to the terms voluntarily. However, notarization or registration is not a strict requirement under Muslim law, but it helps strengthen the document's authenticity in the eyes of the law. 2. Legal Impact and Potential for Challenge: Challenging the Khulanama: Since the Khulā was sent by your ex-wife via registered post, the absence of Kazi or registered authority could make it slightly more vulnerable to challenges. However, the presence of witnesses(from both parties) and the clear agreement to the divorce generally make it a valid document under Muslim law. If either party disputes the Khulā or claims that it was forced or coerced, the lack of formal registration or the absence of a Kazi could allow for potential challenges. In such a case, a court could examine the circumstances surrounding the signing of the Khulā, including the involvement of witnesses and the lack of notarization. 3. Legal Consequences for You: Does it affect your legal status? If the Khulā was executed properly, it would be treated as a divorce under Muslim law, and there should be no ongoing marital obligations between you and your ex-wife. However, since the document was not formalized by a Kazi or court, there is a possibility of future legal complications or challenges, particularly if your ex-wife or her family later disputes the Khulā or seeks to reverse the divorce. 4. Can You Approach a Kazi to Validate It? Validation by a Kazi can add legitimacy to the Khulā. You can approach a local Kazi to have the Khulā formally validated and recorded in the presence of the Kazi. This may involve having the document signed again in the presence of the Kazi, who can then provide an official stamp or validation. This would strengthen the legal standing of the Khulā. Judicial recognition of a Khulā might depend on the jurisdiction of the court you approach, but having the Khulā documented in a formal and official manner is beneficial to avoid future challenges. 5. Steps You Can Take: Approach a Kazi or Darul Qaza: To ensure the document’s legal standing, especially if it is being questioned, you can approach a local Kazi or Darul Qaza to have the Khulā formally recorded. While the absence of these bodies doesn’t automatically invalidate the Khulā, getting it officially recorded can help safeguard against future disputes. Consult a Lawyer: You may want to consult a lawyer experienced in family law and Muslim personal law for further advice on securing your rights and ensuring the Khulā is legally valid and enforceable. Conclusion: While your Khulā may be valid under Muslim personal law, the absence of formalization by a Kazi or court makes it susceptible to future challenges, particularly if any party disputes the terms. It is advisable to approach a Kazi or Darul Qaza to have it validated, which can help in providing legal certainty. Consulting a lawyer specializing in family law can also be a good step to ensure your position is legally protected."

My wife had got divorce decree under section on 30th May 2024 (Section 13(1)(ia) - divorce on the ground of cruelty, Section 13(1)(ib) divorce on the ground of desertion ). I am living abroad, so it took me some time to coordinate with my lawyer and appeal in High Court. With some back and fro, summons was issued to her on Oct 28, 2024. But it has come to my knowledge that she married around Nov 21, 2024. Q1. Let’s suppose she does not appear in High Court and High Court ex-parte overturns the decision of family court; how can I then proceed further. Q2. If summons were not delivered to her before her marriage date, in that case will my appeal will be defunct or still there is something I can get. Q3. . If summons were indeed delivered to her before her marriage date, in that case will what are my options ? Can I charge her for bigamy (I don’t have material evidence for her marriage)",
        "answers": [
            "Your wife has remarried after period of 3 months of divorce decree 2) her remarriage is valid no case of bigamy is made out 3) if HC set asides ex parte decree the case would be remanded to family court for trial 4) your appeal is infructous if summons were not delivered to her before her remarriage",
            "- As per law, the limitation period for filing the appeal or setting aside the ex-parte decree of divorce is 90 days from the date of passing of the decree by the Court. - Since, the said decree was granted to her on 30 May , and she re-marry in Nov,24 it means that her marriage is legal - However , you have right to file the appeal against that decree of divorce on the ground of date of knowledge /information and on the ground of non-service of the summons - Further, if the High Court set-aside the decree then the matter will be remand back to trail family court. - No , bigamy case is maintainable as she has married after the expiry period of 90 days.",
            "The period for filing appeal commenced 31.05.2024. Period of limitation is 90 days from the date of order so in your case limitation had expired on 30.08.2024 while summons were issued to her after expiry of period of limitation and further there was no stay order staying the order dated 30.05.24 so there was no restriction against wife from performing her second marriage. Mere issuance of stay does not amount to stay. Generally high court in such cases try to reconciliate the matter as the wife's second marriage cannot be reverted. No case of bigamy is made out against wife even if you succeed in your appeal. In given circumstances second marriage of wife is fully valid.",
            "1. Even though she may decide not appear before high court, the high court will pass an order on the merits on the grounds of appeal because it appears that the trial court judgment was on the basis of contested divorce and not an exparte divorce. . 2. If she appears before court and informs court that she remarried after the expiration of time limit for filing an appeal but before she received the summons, the court may consider her pleadings as well. 3. It cannot be considered as an act of bigamy because the time limit for filing an appeal is 30 days from the date of judgment excluding the time taken for obtaining certified copies, hence she is very well within her rights to remarry after the time limit for appeal, hence it cannot be considered as an act of bigamy especially in the absence of any stay order staying the judgment delivered by the trial court in this regard. The time limit for filing an appeal against a family court judgment in a divorce case before the high court is 30 days from the date of the judgment. Section 19(3) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 states that an appeal against a judgment or order passed by the Family Court must be filed within 30 days. Hence your thoughts of filing a complaint under bigamy is not maintainable.",

If the High Court overturns the family court’s divorce decree ex-parte: Q2: If the summons were not delivered to her before her marriage date, will your appeal be defunct, or is there recourse?

The police are responsible for investigating the criminal aspects, such as the intent to deceive. Civil Process: A civil recovery suit is focused solely on the recovery of the money you lent. This process is about enforcing the repayment of a debt and does not necessarily concern the criminal aspects like the intention behind not repaying the money. Steps to File a Civil Suit for Money Recovery: Document Collection: Gather all evidence of the loan, including bank transfer details, any communication between you and the borrower acknowledging the debt, and the legal notice you sent. Legal Representation: It would be advisable to hire a lawyer who specializes in civil litigation to draft and file the suit. Your lawyer will prepare a statement of claim outlining the details of the transaction and the subsequent breach (non-payment). Filing the Suit: The suit is filed in the appropriate civil court based on the amount of money involved and the jurisdiction over the area where either the defendant resides or the transaction took place. Court Proceedings: The court will issue a summons to the defendant, and the legal process will follow, where both parties will have the opportunity to present their cases. If the court finds in your favor, it will issue a judgment against the defendant, which can include the debt amount, interest, and possibly legal costs. While the civil case is ongoing, continue to follow up with the police regarding the criminal case. The outcomes of these cases can complement each other; for example, a judgment in the civil case might strengthen the criminal case by establishing the fact of the debt and the default.

        "full_text": "Land issue dispute. PLEASE I am in need!!! Hey! My name is Amaar and I am a permanent resident of Jammu & Kashmir, Srinagar. We have a land of 5716sqfts with two side entrance and a single house of the front entrance. The whole plot was on my father’s Elder uncle name (A) who had no son or daughter and my grandfather (B) and his younger brother (C) use to live with him. After my grand father’s marriage when my father was born the elder brother (A) of my grandfather on whose name was the land he gave my grandfather 1350sqft land from the whole land to make a house behind the existing house verbally without any documentation. Then after the marriage of my grandfather’s younger brother (C), (A) Gave him (C) 810sqft land on the other entrance of the land verbally without any documentation. So the whole plot with two entrances have two houses and our house of my grandfather was in the center of the two houses the whole plot was marked with a common pathway from front to back keeping my grandfather’s (B) house in the center or we can say at the back. Then in 2003 the (A) who had no son gave 2900sqft to his younger brother (C) with a gift deed and my grandfather was unaware of it. Then in 2007 the (A) elder brother of my grandfather died. Then in 2023 we got to know about the gift deed. I am living in my grandfather’s house but the land is still on his elder brother’s name (A). So 2900sqft in on my grandfather’s younger brother’s name. The house i am living in has 1350sqft land and the remaining 1466sqft is the common pathway of 4ft width and length of 361aprox. So back in 2014by a connection of my friends i made a new document of my land as abadi deh land as my grandfather(B)was in the possession of the land 1350sqft from 70 years. I got a proper sale deed on my wife’s name the proper revenue documents. Its been 10years now i have the documents. Also the land documents of these 1350sqft land was originally in the ownership name of my grandfather’s eleder brother’s name (A) but they were never found he never gave it to anyone no one knows where are they. We tried finding then in revenue but were never found. Also my grandfather was never given any land from it as all they have was this land to live on. SO I HAVE 2 QUESTIONS: 1) is my ownership (wife name documents) legal? 2) can i claim the direct pathway excess to the two gates because i have to walk around their two houses to get the excess to the main road. There is some land vacant which was gifted by (A) to (C)",

I asked them to share photo proof of the car before taking delivery and they refused saying they don't keep any photographs of the car before the rental. I know for sure this damage did not happen during my rental period. But they are not accepting this. I checked online and there are many reviews stating this car rental company does it for all their customers. There are many negative and bad reviews about this rental company online.

Since you are in India, they will not be able to recover the claimed damages even if they obtain an exparte order from a court of that country. They may have to spend ten times more than the claim amount. Hence you may either ignore their claim and remain silent or issuer a legal notice through a lawyer stating that their demand is illegal especially when they refuse to furnish the details of the damage with photo evidence or any other substantial evidence to establish the facts. Besides you have already purchased insurance policy toward any such event hence the insurance company can compensate the claim amount if at all the damages are real. Therefore you can decide about issuing s legal notice through a lawyer elaborating the details and throwing the burden on them to prove their claim and remain silent without pursuing the matter any further."

I want to ensure that I can assist him in managing these responsibilities efficiently and legally on his behalf. Below are the key points I would like clarification on: 1. Scope of the Power of Attorney • Type of PoA: Should I opt for a general power of attorney or a specific one? • Scope of Authority: Can the PoA cover: o Financial transactions, including managing bank accounts, investments, and tax filings? o Legal matters, such as signing contracts, appearing in legal proceedings, and handling disputes? o Property-related dealings, such as buying, selling, renting, or leasing properties? • Can multiple authorities (like the above) be combined into a single PoA document, or do I need separate PoAs? • Registration: Is registering with a sub-registrar or another authority like the notary public is mandatory? What are the steps involved? • Validity: How long does the PoA remain valid? Should there be a specific end date or an event triggering its revocation? Execution in Multiple Jurisdictions • If the PoA needs to be executed in different cities or states, does it require additional legalization or notarization?

            "Dear Client, I strongly advise him to be given General Power of Attorney. Under this arrangement, your father can manage all his financial and legal affairs and property in one single document for the purpose of covering financial transactionbank management, investments, taxes, legal matters like signing of contracts and settlement of disputes with properties such as buying selling or leasing. It must be registered in the Sub-Registrar's office in the case of property-related powers; notarization is enough for monetary and legal purposes. In this case, the drafting of the PoA, visiting the Sub-Registrar with identification documents and witnesses, paying the stamp duty, and registration fees are followed. The time or event-bound, or it remains indefinite unless formally revoked by your father. In case it is executed across cities or states, the registered PoA is valid across all states, but with added authenticity through notarization, and stamp duty would vary according to jurisdictions. A well-drafted and registered PoA ensures smooth and legally secure procedure by empowering you to be more effective in assisting your father. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute."

I never bothered because I thought this was a normal thing to do. (The reason that I remember for why my father altered my date of birth is this - I was small when he said this, but if I could recall it, it was this: \"The date of birth is altered so that if I failed in 10th Exam, I could give 10th Exam again next year without having an effect on my age, which would help me in getting jobs later on.\") As I grew up, I don't know what happened to me - but for some reason - I cannot lie, or cannot hide anything. So, I felt like to correct my date of birth too in my Birth Certificate - which I never felt before. But I also know this cannot be done maybe as all of my documents have this date of birth, i.e., 15.04.2002. I also asked my father and confirmed that we do not have the Hospital Discharge Certificate (or if we ever had one).

I was ready to give him the flat however I asked him to pay me the money that I had given him after marriage. However he doesn't want to pay me the money. And now I fed up with all the mental harassment, and I am unable to live without my son. I want to file a petition for divorce and fight for child custody as we are unable to agree on mutual terms.

        "full_text": "Sick and Casual Leaves in Telangana S&E Act. Section 30(5) of the the Telngana S&E Act reads as below - Every employee in any establishment shall also be entitled during his first twelve months of continuous service and during every subsequent twelve months of service (a) to leave with wages for a period \"not exceeding twelve days on the ground of any sickness or accident and (b) to casual leave with wages for a period not exceeding twelve days\" on any reasonable ground. The above provision says \"NOT EXCEEDING\" 12 days in case of sick and casual leaves. Whereas the other provisions either specify the exact number of leaves or use the term \"NOT LESS THAN\". My question is does this imply and mean that an organization can give less than 12 days of sick and casual leave i.e. 6 days of casual leave and 6 days of sick leave?",
        "answers": [
            "Yes, the wording \"not exceeding twelve days\" in Section 30(5) of the Telangana Shops and Establishments Act suggests that the law sets a maximum limit of twelve days each for sick leave and casual leave. Therefore, an organization can indeed choose to provide fewer than twelve days for each type of leave, such as six days of casual leave and six days of sick leave, as long as the total number of such leaves provided does not exceed the specified twelve days per type annually. This flexibility allows employers to set their own leave policies within the bounds of this maximum limit specified by the Act, meaning they can offer less than twelve days, but not more. For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy. Hope you find the information helpful. You are free to contact me for further discussion. If you could spare two minutes of your time to write a review, it would be greatly appreciated and bring immense happiness to read it. Thank you. Shubham Goyal.",
            "You are entitled to 12 days of sick and casual leave you can apply for said leave employer cannot refuse to give you sick and casual leave if it is not more than 12 days",
            "Section 30(5) of the Telangana Shops and Establishments Act uses the term \"not exceeding twelve days\" for sick leave and casual leave, which implies that an organisation has the discretion to provide fewer than 12 days of each type of leave. Unlike provisions in the Act that specify exact entitlements or minimum thresholds using terms like \"not less than,\" the phrase \"not exceeding\" sets a maximum limit. This allows employers to decide the allocation of sick and casual leave within the ceiling of 12 days, for example, providing 6 days of sick leave and 6 days of casual leave. However, the total leave granted for sickness or casual reasons cannot exceed the stipulated 12-day limit. Organisations must ensure their leave policies align with this provision unless employment contracts, company policies, or state-level notifications mandate otherwise. To avoid disputes, employers should clearly outline their leave policies in employee handbooks, ensuring compliance with the law while considering employee welfare and market standards. For personalised assistance in drafting or reviewing leave policies, feel free to schedule a consultation",
            "Yes it means both or any leave not more than 12 days",
            "an organization can provide less than twelve days of sick and casual leave, such as six days each, as the provision states not exceeding twelve days, allowing for flexibility in the number of leave days granted."

No court can comple a person to live with other against his/her wishes so even if you succeed even then court order would remain ineffective. since wife is earning so she may not not be able to claim maintenance. 2. None. However, wife may raise demand for seperate residence so court may order to husband to arrange rented accommodation for wife. 3. Yes, mutual settlement is best but inly court order and decree can dissolve a marriage. Except court there is no other mode or authority to dissolve a marriage.",
            "Dear Client, In your case, with the wife working and bringing in ₹4.5 lakhs per annum and no children, the demand for ₹20 lakhs can be contested as unreasonable. You can file a restitution of conjugal rights petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, but this may not be effective because your wife has already made a declaration to the court for a divorce. Filing RCR may delay the process of divorce, and the court may still order interim maintenance based on both parties' incomes; however, the amount will probably be very minimal considering that she is earning. In case you decide to continue with divorce, amounts of alimony or settlement will depend on factors such as the period of marriage, incomes, and standard of living; since she is earning, the amount may be substantially reduced. A mediated settlement is likely to be faster and less costly than a contested process in the courts, which would take about 2-3 years. Negotiate a mutually acceptable amount of settlement based on her requirements and economic independence to wrap up the matter amicably, avoiding lengthy litigation. Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.",
            "You can go for the mutual consent divorce instead of the RCR and take an order from the court of MCD. You can make the first MoU before MCD, and there is no need to pay her alimony as she is a working woman and sufficient to take care of herself.",
            "1. RCR is not a solution besides it is a waste exercise. If you feel that it would be no more possible to tolerate her behavior or continue this marital relationship, you can go for mutual consent divorce on negotiated terms. 2. She is employed and earning a handsome salary income hence she will not be eligible for maintenance or alimony, you collect her income details by documents and fight it out properly in case she files a petition seeking maintenance. 3. It may take two to three years if the case is conducted by contested divorce, hence you can decide about negotiated settlement if you want to get rid of it quickly."

The husband must also not have had sexual intercourse with her during this time. Another type of legally valid talaq is by pronouncing Talaq Hasan. The husband divorces his wife by making three pronouncements of divorce during the wife's menstrual cycles. However both are legally valid.

Under the RERA Act, it is binding upon developers to perform in accordance with the agreement. Delay in refunds might incur penalties. Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.",

Before humans like you purchased flats built by builders on those lands these street dogs lived there and therefore it is their birth place and natural habitat. In a polity governed by the rule of law the majoritarianism does not prevail. Few or majority residents cannot be allowed to gang up and quell the rights of the feeders and those who are fed by them. As long as the feeders are feeding in accordance with rules laid down by Animal Welfare Board of India they cannot be stopped from doing so. The Supreme Court has now upheld the ABC Rules 2023 in its final judgment rendered in April this year. Under ABC Rules the street dogs are to be subjected to compulsory sterilisation (surgical removal of their reproductive organs) so that they do not multiply in numbers and they become docile. It has a specific provision pertaining to feeding of street dogs. It is the duty of your RWA to arrange feeding spots for street dogs under ABC Rules, 2023. If your place has street dogs who are not neutered then call the Municipal Corporation and get them neutered, but this mob mentality will not get you anywhere.",
            "even if you have majority you can’t remove them. If they are attacking someone such experts can be hired who will treat them. There are NGOs for the same. Humans are not the master of this planet. The dogs have rights too. Society can make rules for dog lovers to feed dogs at a designated place in society without creating nuisance and unhygienic conditions. Dogs are even present in high court and Supreme Court premises"

Wife claimed she had no source of income and was living in poverty with their children. She alleged the husband's income was ₹90,000 per month and demanded ₹30,000 as maintenance. 3. April 2024: Interim Maintenance Order: During proceedings, the family court ordered interim maintenance of ₹10,000 per month, comprising ₹6,000 for the wife and ₹2,000 each for the two children. B. Evidence Presented by Husband: 1. Husband discovered and submitted evidence in court proving the wife was employed as a Madrasa Shikshak (teacher) and received her salary through the district treasury. 2.

Based on discrepancies in the wife’s affidavits and court submissions, husband filed an application under Section 340 CrPC, alleging perjury and misrepresentation. 2. The family court accepted the husband's application for hearing. Major Concern is: Court's Decision on Maintenance (April 2024): Despite evidence of the wife’s income and pending Section 340 CrPC proceedings, the family court ruled under Section 125 CrPC, ordering the husband to pay ₹14,000 per month as maintenance, effective from the date of the wife’s application. Notice has also been issued for the same. D. High Court Appeal (May 2024): The husband challenged the family court’s decision in the High Court, filing a revision petition where husband has argued that 1. the Section 340 CrPC application, which addresses the wife’s alleged perjury and false claims, should have been disposed of before deciding on the Section 125 CrPC maintenance order. 2. Case Status (June 2024): The Section 125 CrPC revision petition is pending before the High Court. 3. The husband awaits the resolution of his Section 340 CrPC application in the family court, which he asserts is pivotal to the Section 125 case. Legal Help Needed on below Key Issues: 1.

            "1. It is unfortunate that the trial court has passed maintenance amount in favor of the wife despite the fact that she is employed and drawing salary income regularly from various appointments/posts especially when she has reportedly admitted the same during cross examination. 2. It appears that the orders passed towards grant of maintenance insofar as to the wife despite proving that she is having sufficient income may be considered as erroneous judgment. You may in your appeal strongly object to this error and get it set aside."

        "full_text": "Legal Advice for Buying a Plot Around Hyderabad - Developer Acting Under GPA and Ownership Concerns. Dear Lawyers, I am planning to buy a residential plot in Telangana that is part of an HMDA-approved layout. The developer is acting under a General Power of Attorney (GPA) granted by the landowner. However, there are gaps in the ownership history, and I have concerns about the legal risks associated with this purchase. Below are my questions: 1)Ownership and Title Verification: How can I verify the complete ownership history of the property, especially if records do not explain how the current landowner acquired it before 2005(pahani records from 2005)?Can the absence of earlier ownership details (e.g., inheritance, purchase, or government allotment) pose risks to my ownership in the future? 2)GPA and Developer Agreement: Is it safe to buy property where the developer, acting under a GPA, executes the sale deed without the landowner directly participating? What risks arise if the GPA is revoked, contested by the landowner or their heirs, or deemed invalid? How can I mitigate these risks? Should the sale deed explicitly reference the GPA details and include an indemnity clause to protect me from future claims? What key clauses should I verify in the Development Agreement between the landowner and developer to ensure the transaction is legally sound? 3)Approvals and Land Use: Does HMDA approval ensure that the layout and property are legally compliant? Are there specific conditions in the approval I should verify? How can I confirm whether this project is registered under RERA? Is RERA registration mandatory for such developments? What should I check in the land conversion approval (agricultural to residential use) to ensure there are no pending conditions or risks? 4)Registration and Finalization: Should I insist on the landowner co-signing the sale deed along with the GPA holder (developer) for added security? What steps can I take to ensure the sale deed and registration process are legally binding and protect me from third-party claims? 5)General Risks: How can I verify that the property is not classified as Waqf land, Full Tank Level (FTL),Hydraa or government-assigned land, or forest land? Are there risks of undisclosed encumbrances or claims from earlier owners or legal heirs, and how can I protect myself? 6)Is title insurance or any other insurance recommended in this case, and what specific risks should it cover? 7)Final Advice:Based on the above, would you recommend proceeding with this purchase? What are the key precautions I should take to ensure the title is clear and ownership is secure? Additional Context: The land conversion is approved for residential use. The HMDA layout has been sanctioned. The sale deed will likely be executed by the developer under the GPA. There are no records explaining how the landowner acquired the property before 2005. Please advise on the legal risks and steps I should take to safeguard my investment. Thanks in advance Best regards",

Obtain documents such as pahani records, title deeds, mutation records, and encumbrance certificates that reflect the complete ownership history. Verify that the GPA is real and that it is also registered, irrevocable, and specific to sale; include GPA details and indemnity clause in the sale deed; ensure HMDA and RERA compliance with duly accorded land conversion approvals with no outstanding encumbrances such as Waqf lands, FTL, or government classifications; demand co-signing of the sale deed by the landowner for additional security; verify the development agreement between the landowner and developer. Consider title insurance to cover such risks as undisclosed claims or ownership disputes. Proceed only if all records are clear, approvals valid, and the title is secure. Hope that this helps you to solve your problem.",

If such a boundary wall was erected by you on your property, then without your permission, barbed wires cannot be done. That may amount to trespass and by law you would have each right to claim removal of something like that after serving notice demanding such removal. If they refuse, you can sue them civilly to get an injunction compelling them not to do any unauthorized alteration or incursion on your property. Again, the same goes for planting trees, and the same is allowed unless and until no nuisance emerges from it. If the trees border the boundary wall, their roots or branches may go into your property damaging the wall or obstruct sunlight or falling debris; in which case, such may constitute a nuisance under property law. You can then ask your neighbor to cut down or remove the trees. You may even draft a letter to the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation or even file a civil suit, in case they are not agreeing to your demands. First of all, I would say you must have had formal communications for settlement amicably in that matter. And in case it is still persisting, then you would require to send legal notices or further legal proceedings for protecting your rights in that property. Hope that this helps you to solve your problem."

Of this, ₹4,95,500 was transferred to Mr. Abdul Mohsin’s account as per Mr. Iqbal’s instructions, citing that his own account had active EMI deductions.

Cheque Bounce: Mr. Iqbal issued two post-dated cheques: ₹2,48,000 (bounced 3 times for \"Insufficient Funds\"). ₹2,00,000 (expiry due in 2 months and no funds). Both cheques were taken back by Mr. Iqbal and replaced with two new cheques: Cheque No. 12345 for ₹2,48,000. Cheque No. 6789 for ₹2,00,000.

            "Dear Client, In the Present Scenario, the tenancy agreement for the non-residential property was signed in June 1992 for a period of 10 years and expired in May 2002. Herein, the tenant continued paying rent during the agreement period, but an eviction notice was served in 2012, which the tenant acknowledged. The original tenant passed away in March 2019, and presently, in 2024, the tenant’s grandson occupied the property with force, and without any legal authority. Under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (WBPTA), tenancy rights can only be inherited by specific heirs who reside with the tenant at the time of their death, and here, the grandchildren are excluded unless proven to be dependent at the time of death. Here, since the tenancy agreement expired in 2002, and the grand child does not qualify as a tenant under WBPTA, his continued occupation is unauthorised. For the same, legal action may be taken by filing a complaint/eviction suit, and the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, citing the expiration of the tenancy and lack of legal authority. Additionally, a claim for mesne profits may be made for illegal occupation. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",

In case the magistrate fails to take proper action you can go to sessions court under Section 438 of BNSS (previously, Section 397 of CrPC) and ask for revision so as to ensure that the summons are enforced to compel the accused to appear. It is necessary to take records of all the hearings and stay in touch with your attorney to manage this process and achieve the goal of punishment for the accused.

            "Dear Client, In Kerala, the land use regulations are governed by the Kerala Town and Country Planning Act, 2016, and the Kerala Municipality Act, 1994. These laws require certain permissions for converting residential plots to commercial use. If the driving school is operating on a residential plot without conversion to commercial use, it might be in violation of these regulations. Under the Kerala Municipality Act, the Corporation or Municipality is responsible for regulating land use and ensuring compliance with zoning laws. If the plot has not been converted for commercial purposes, operating a driving school there without permission could be illegal. You can pursue a civil suit for nuisance and seek relief for damages and an injunction to prevent further disturbances. Request the court to issue a mandatory injunction to prevent the driving school from operating until proper permissions are obtained and the nuisance is addressed. Petition the Municipal Corporation to take immediate safety measures such as installing a boundary wall or barriers to prevent accidents and protect your property. Engage with local authorities to ensure compliance with safety and land use regulations. For Criminal recourse, you can request the police to register an FIR Considering that the preliminary investigation confirms that the allegations are true. you can file a complaint with the Superintendent of Police or approach the Magistrate to direct the police to register the FIR.",

        "full_text": "How to proceed with domestic violence case and 498a. My sister married a man in March 2023. Before their engagement, he was already in a relationship with his girlfriend, but kept this hidden. Just 10-20 days before the wedding date, he finally confessed to my sister about his girlfriend and his infidelity. He promised my sister he would be a good husband and care for her without any issues after marriage. Fearing she wouldn't find another marriage prospect and concerned about family prestige, my sister proceeded with the wedding without any recorded proof of this conversation. Within the first month of marriage (March 2023), he was caught red-handed meeting his girlfriend in a hotel. His parents and he desperately begged my sister not to inform our family, promising this wouldn't happen again. In her state of shock, my sister didn't document this incident and didn't tell us until months later, which is why we didn't intervene at that time. One evening between 8-10 PM, his parents verbally abused my sister in front of other family members, making baseless accusations about her character. Hurt by these allegations, she left their house around midnight (12:00-12:30 AM), informing her husband while leaving. When my mother and I later took her back to her in-laws' home and confronted them about the affair and abuse, his mother demanded proof of the affair and denied the abuse. Instead, they criticized my sister for leaving home late at night without telling anyone. Despite this confrontation, my mother encouraged them to reconcile. Later, during my sister's visit to our home, her husband blocked her on WhatsApp without explanation and wouldn't answer calls. When my mother contacted his parents and elder brother about this, they dismissed it as a minor issue. After a family meeting with elders, my sister returned to her in-laws' home. In September 2023, her father-in-law inappropriately questioned my sister about her physical relationship with her husband, which led to her confronting him angrily. This November, when my sister wanted to visit our home for some work, she tried calling her husband, but his phone was switched off. After an argument with her father-in-law about this, she left their home. Her husband continues to ignore her calls. They live in Bengaluru while we're in Andhra Pradesh. My sister also works in Bengaluru in hybrid work mode. We want to arrange a family discussion to either work toward reconciliation or proceed with divorce, but they seem to not care about coming to our town or my sister leaving their home.

Later the land was sold in the year 1992 (the land was hold up-to 13 years 1 month). Now the property has been converted and layout has been formed in the same.. Developer provided Form 10 and it says - \"Provided also that the land of which the occupancy has been granted to any person shall not within SIX years from the date of the certificate under Section 55 is issued\". The question here is , will that Karnataka Land Reforms act 1961 affect me in the future, if I buy a plot in the mentioned property and will I face any legal issues in further period... (because 1961 act says lock-in period is 15 years, but Form 10 clearly says 6 years will be the lock-in period). With all the above situation, Can i purchase a plot or not?

The builder who made the layout will not be available to face the legal issues after selling the flats.

To avoid future legal issues, it is suggested that, you verify the grant conditions given under Form 10, and confirm that the 1992 sale had the requisite permissions, and thus, ensure that, he land’s conversion and layout formation were duly approved by competent authorities. However, it is also important that you obtain the title verification, the encumbrance certificate, and review the entire chain of ownership with a property lawyer specialising in Karnataka land laws. Herein, if all the processes are lawful and compliant, you may proceed with the purchase. But, if there exists any violations thereby, the transfer may have challenges involved. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",
            "Legal Compliance: The land sale in 1992 happened after the lock-in period (13 years), so it complies with both 6-year and 15-year rules under Section 55. Key Checks Before Purchase: Developer Documents: Ensure proper land conversion, layout approval, and Form 10 compliance. Conclusion: Likely safe to purchase, but consult a property lawyer for due diligence to avoid risks."

            "Dear Client, In the Present Scenario, subsequent to the divorce, alimony would be determined based on various factors, including the duration of the marriage, financial capacity of both spouses, and the wife’s ability to support herself, and so on. Under the BNSS, maintenance is typically granted if the wife is unable to maintain herself, but since your wife is earning Rs. 40,000 per month and has been living separately, her claim for alimony may be reduced. Further, under Hindu Marriage Act, the provisions allow for interim maintenance during divorce proceedings, and permanent alimony based on the husband’s income and the wife’s financial capacity. Here, your monthly income is Rs. 1.4 lakhs, and since your wife is employed, the court will consider your financial obligations you have, as well as her ability to support herself. Further, since your marriage lasted only about 13 months and your wife has not contributed financially to you or the marriage, the court may award an alimony of certain percentage of your monthly income. Additionally, the issues you have, your medical check-ups and so on, would also strengthen your case for divorce. However, it is suggested that you maintain the documentation and salary details of both you and your spouse, so as to maintain a proof for your defence. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",
            "- As per Supreme Court judgment, wife is expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter. - Further, the court granted divorce to a man on the grounds of “cruelty” after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws. - Hence, as per law, she cannot deny living with you, under the condition of separate living from your mother. - Further, If wife is not supporting her husband for the enjoyment of life and denying relation, then the husband can get divorce after filing a divorce petition before the court on this ground. Further, As per Delhi High Court, physical intimacy is an essential aspect of marriage and a wife's continuous refusal to have such relationship with her husband can be a ground for divorce, - Hence, if she is not interested to live with you, then try to take her consent for mutual divorce. - If, she not agrees for mutual divorce, then file a divorce petition on the above mentioned grounds. - Since, she has left you, then for your safeguards, you can lodged a complaint before the police and higher official, as an information, after mentioning the details and also for threatening to implicate you in false dowry cases. - Since, she is earning then she cannot claim maintenance from you."

As per the agreement , the purchaser has agreed to pay the full amount within 1 month . There is no cancellation clause as such . Now 2 months have passed and the buyer keeps giving excuses about home loan , family issues etc . Finally I told him let’s cancel the deal and he agreed to it . He said he will go to his lawyer , get the cancellation. Deed drafted and call Me to Pune when the deed is ready . He keeps postponing and lying about this and I have another buyer who is waiting to buy the property. What course of action do I have ? 1. Does him not paying within 1 month breach the contract and make the agreement to sale void? 2.

            "1. Send a legal notice to the buyer for honouring the time mentioned in the agreement of sale, i.e., one month. It's a breach of contract on his part. 2. It will be illegal to go ahead with another buyer, when the agreement of sale is subsisting with the first buyer. 3.

            "Dear Client, In the Present Scenario, you may consider the Indian Contract Act, 1872, under which, the failure of the purchaser to pay the full amount within one month, as agreed in the registered Agreement to Sale, constitutes a breach of contract. While this breach makes the purchaser liable, the agreement remains valid until formally cancelled or declared void. Furthermore, according to the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, an Agreement to Sale does not transfer ownership but creates a contractual obligation, meaning selling the property to another buyer without cancelling the first agreement could expose you to a legal action. However, to proceed further with this, you may send a legal notice to the first buyer citing the breach, and demanding cancellation of the agreement. However, if he continues to delay, you can take the initiative to draft a cancellation deed, clearly stating whether you intend to refund or forfeit the advance payment of ₹1. In case of non-compliance or not co-operating to any of your actions, you may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act, 1963, seeking a declaration that the agreement is void due to non-performance. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",

        "full_text": "Problem with lawyers. I am reaching out in a state of helplessness, seeking guidance and assistance. It pains me to see how humanity and fairness seem to be lost when dealing with NRIs. Please understand that being an NRI does not mean we are devoid of families, emotions, or struggles. Unfortunately, some lawyers seem to treat NRIs as mere opportunities to exploit for financial gain. I am an Australian citizen, and my ex-wife, who was an Australian permanent resident even before our marriage, has been exploiting legal loopholes against me. We separated in February 2016 and obtained a mutual divorce in Australia in August 2018. I have been consistently paying child support since then. However, in December 2018 3 months after divorce, she filed a false Section 498A case against me and my family in India, with the apparent intention of extorting money. She continues to reside and work in Australia. Due to the Look-Out Circular (LOC) issued against me, I have not been able to travel to India since 2018. My attempts to resolve this legally have been extremely frustrating: First Lawyer: In March 2022, I paid ₹120,000 to a lawyer who filed a criminal petition in the Telangana High Court. After the court ordered notice to the other party, the lawyer stopped responding, used abusive language when I followed up, and eventually blocked my number. Second Lawyer: After obtaining an NOC, I appointed another lawyer who suggested bribing the judge with ₹15 lakhs, which I refused. Third Lawyer: In September 2024, I paid ₹50,000 to another lawyer who assured me the case would be listed and quashed quickly. However, after filing the vakalat, he started giving evasive and implausible reasons, such as judges not hearing older cases, and has shown no intent to address my case effectively. I am in urgent need of a resolution. My elderly parents in India require my presence, and I can no longer delay visiting them. I seek clarity on whether it is possible to get my case quashed in the Supreme Court of India based on the recognition of my Australian divorce decree. I am willing to pay for genuine and effective legal services. If there is any lawyer or firm that can help me get my case quashed within a reasonable time frame (ideally within three months), I would greatly appreciate the assistance. I am a human being with a family and emotions, and I ask not to be treated as a source of exploitation simply because I am an NRI. Please help me bring this nightmare to an end.",

            "These cases are very common in various Courts of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. This practice is being adopted as a matter for recovering the outstanding in case of eventuality. From the lender side they are more concerned about the recovery of the money with the contracted interest amount. Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that if in a transaction, a loan is advanced and the borrower agrees to repay the amount in a specified timeframe and issues a cheque as security to secure such repayment; if the loan amount is not repaid in any other form before the due date or if there is no other understanding or agreement between the parties to defer the payment of amount, the cheque which is issued as security would mature for presentation and the drawee of the cheque would be entitled to present the same. On such presentation, if the same is dishonoured, the consequences contemplated under Section 138 and the other provisions of N.I. Act would flow. When a cheque is issued even though as ‘security’ the consequence flowing therefrom is also known to the drawer of the cheque and in the circumstance stated above if the cheque is presented and dishonoured, the holder of the cheque/drawee would have the option of initiating the civil proceedings for recovery or the criminal proceedings for punishment in the fact situation, but in any event, it is not for the drawer of the cheque to dictate terms with regard to the nature of litigation. However, there are always defences available as per facts and circumstances of each case. Since you have already received the summons, therefore, the case has to appropriately defended.

            "The act on part of bank is legal and is in consonance of law. Bank never accept cheque as security. So when you failed in making payment bank had deposited cheque to recover pending EMI. In loan agreement also bank keep clause for recovery of entire loan amount at once. Nothing wrong on part of bank. No purpose would be served in approaching high court.",
            "Your principles al defence that blank cheque was given as security that amount mentioned in cheque was not due and payable as only 2 EMI were outstanding 3) when a blank cheque is issued you authorise the bank to fill in details and present the cheque for payment 4) the fact that bank can sell the property does not prevent bank from filing case on basis of dishonoured cheque",
            "There is no legal infirmity in using the security cheque for recovering the defaulted loan amount. The bank issued a statutory legal demand notice before filing the cheque bounce case, whereas you failed to avail the opportunity. Therefore the bank has exercised its right to recover the loan amount especially when you continuously defaulted the EMI for two months. The bank cannot make it NPA for two months default. hence for putting pressure on you they have adopted this method. The high court may not entertain any petition for quash. hence you may better contact bank itself and negotiate settlement amount."

While this breach makes the purchaser liable, the agreement remains valid until formally cancelled or declared void. Furthermore, according to the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, an Agreement to Sale does not transfer ownership but creates a contractual obligation, meaning selling the property to another buyer without cancelling the first agreement could expose you to a legal action. However, to proceed further with this, you may send a legal notice to the first buyer citing the breach, and demanding cancellation of the agreement. However, if he continues to delay, you can take the initiative to draft a cancellation deed, clearly stating whether you intend to refund or forfeit the advance payment of ₹1. In case of non-compliance or not co-operating to any of your actions, you may file a suit under the Specific Relief Act, 1963, seeking a declaration that the agreement is void due to non-performance.

        "full_text": "Cheque bounce case filed for Secured Home loan when its not even NPA. I have the following Technical Questions. I believe Law is not meant to be applied mechanically and these questions require a little more deeper considerations 1. Pledged Security: The bank has my home as the \"pledged Security\" and not those \"Blank Cheques\" which were taken way back in 2015 as specially to coerce the gullible borrower 2. In a Mortgage Loan agreement, Does bank mention those \"Blank Cheques\" as Security and the entire Loan amount being disbursed based on Those Cheques 3. Where is the Question of Criminality in a Secured Loan when the bank can recover the dues by selling out the pledged property 4. When Bank Deposited these \"Entire amount\" Cheques only Two EMI were outstanding then How come Bank Deposit the cheque of the entire loan amount which was outstanding, the Loan was never NPA and I am still making EMI Payment till date I think for any secure Loan using 138 itself is gross misuse of this act as the purpose of this act as I understand is to prevent Frauds and Cheating and borrower has no other means to recover the dues I might convert this into a PIL and will appreciate considered opinions",
        "answers": [
            "Your defence should be that no debt was due and payable when case was filed it was a security cheque ,account t had not been declared NPA only 2 EMI were due and payable",
            "1. ?? 2. No. 3. On dishonouring of cheque, non payment etc are incidents of criminality. 4. NPA declaration is not prerequisite condition for depositing cheque. Under agreement bank is protected to recover full amount at any stage. As such there is no misuse. Courts are there to watch. Your understanding of law and 138 is not correct.",
            "The bank has rights to recover the defaulted loan by the easiest and fastest method available before it. Even though there is a provision to make the loan account NPA for default in repayment for continuous three months, banks are not prevented from filing cheque bounce case. The act on part of bank is legal and is correct and proper as per prevailing law. Now you are talking about filing PIL . A PIL cannot be filed against individuals, but only against the Central Government, municipal governments, or State Government. It also cannot be filed for matters related to: Landlord-tenant, Services, Pension and Gratuity, and Complaints against central and state government departments and local bodies. SO YOU MAY CONSULT AN EXPERIENCED LAWYER IN LOCAL AND PROCEED AS SUGGESTED",
            "What you think is not important as as long as the law of the land does not support it. Till this very moment the security cheque is still considered as valid cheque for the purpose of initiating a proceeding under section 138 of NI Act on its dishonour unless you prove that on the relevant date of dsihonour there was no valid debt existing in your name.",

Key Facts: Visa Expiry: My H-1B visa expires on February 13, 2025, and I must leave the U.S. to avoid unlawful presence. My spouse’s H-4 visa, tied to mine, also expires on the same date, but she does not intend to leave the U.S. A U.S. court order prevents either parent from taking our child out of Connecticut, but as her primary caregiver for the last 13 months, I cannot leave without her. Dual Proceedings: I filed for divorce in India under cruelty in Nov 2023 (Hindu), and my spouse has filed for restitution of marriage, custody, and maintenance there and participated in proceedings till Sep 2024 She also filed for divorce and custody in the U.S. upon arriving with just four months left on her visa. The U.S. judge seems inclined to retain custody jurisdiction while delaying the motion to dismiss the divorce case. My spouse has supervised visitation orders in both jurisdictions. Financial Constraints: I am under immense financial pressure, fighting cases in both countries, while also paying $20,000 lump sum and monthly maintenance per U.S. court orders. Questions: How can I request relocation with my daughter to India given my visa constraints and caregiving role? How do I address dual proceedings to avoid conflicting judgments and financial strain? What legal options do I have if the U.S. court does not permit relocation and my visa expires? How do I address the judge’s bias, particularly regarding unsustainable financial orders and the suggestion to extend my spouse’s visa, which is illegal?

No documents are pending. On next day, we received e-mail stating police verification has been initiated. However, on very next day, we received a file closer notification letter for insufficient documents and asking to meet in person at RPO Chandigarh. The discrepancy in question is that my name appears as \"Kamal Ram\" on her 10th-grade mark sheet, whereas both my Aadhaar card and her passport application list my name as \"Kamal.\" According to me the required documents that establish identity and relationship, including Aadhaar card and birth certificate, have already been submitted. Class 10th certificate is only required for ECNR. My eldest daughter (Misha Kumari) with same documents has been recently granted passport. Now, when all documents are accepted and police verification is initiated, RPO is sending file closer notifications letter. Which is little confusing and frustrating for parents.

Explain the Name Discrepancy: Clarify that the name difference is minor and does not affect identity verification since the Class 10 certificate is only for ECNR purposes. Request Alternative Solution: Ask if a notarized affidavit confirming your name can be accepted instead of an updated mark sheet.

            "Dear Client, In your case regarding Hemal Kumari's passport renewal application, it is essential to address the discrepancy concerning your name on her Class 10 mark sheet. The passport office has the authority to request additional documentation to verify identity and relationship, especially if there are inconsistencies in the submitted documents. Under the Passport Act, 1967, the authorities can seek clarification regarding documents submitted for passport applications. The requirement for consistent documentation is crucial for establishing identity and relationship. You should attend the meeting at the Regional Passport Office (RPO) in Chandigarh with all relevant documents, including your Aadhaar card and Hemal's birth certificate, to clarify the discrepancy. Explain that your eldest daughter was granted a passport with similar documentation. While the passport office can delay or deny the application based on insufficient documentation, presenting a clear explanation and supporting documents may resolve the issue. If necessary, consider applying for a correction in the Class 10 mark sheet through CBSE, although this process can be lengthy. Hope this answers your query."

In a Family partition deed, the entire plot of land excluding common passage were divided equally among 2 families wherein parties A, B & C are one family (1 father and 2 sons) and parties D & E are another family (1 father and son). There is a common passage (private) to be shared by all parties A, B, C, D & E wherein the value of common passage is mentioned seperately under respective schedules of all the above parties along with their respective share of plots. Value of Common passage specifically mentioned in partition deed for A is Rs.5000, B is Rs.5000, C is Rs.5000, D is Rs.7500 & E is Rs.7500, Totally valued at Rs.30000. Subsequently, Parties A & D (both the fathers of each family) having adjacent plots next to each other had ventured into a joint development with a builder to construct apartments having seperate main entrances on the other side of the road and had blocked their access to common passage with a compound wall which has been in existence for more than 30 years. Now the remaining parties B, C & E (being the sons of each family) are the only users to the common passage for more than 30 years. The following questions now arises. 1. Can the remaining parties B, C & E along with their respective share of plots venture into a Joint development agreement with a builder to utilise the common passage area of more than a ground as part of construction of apartments? 2. If yes, what will be their respective share of value in common passage? and what happens to the value of share in common passage held by parties A & D which has been already redeveloped into apartments? 3. What happens when Party C doesn't give his consent for redevelopment? Can the other parties buyout his proportionate share in common passage thereby relinquishing his rights and proceed with redevelopment among the remaining parties? Note: Party C also has their own entrance other than common passage. 4. Kindly please help with the methods to arrive at the proportionate share value for the above question to execute buyout from Party C.

The shares of A and D, who no longer use or have interest in the passage, would need to be addressed legally (e.g., relinquishment, compensation) to avoid future disputes. Non-Consent of Party C: If C does not give consent, the remaining parties may attempt to buy out C's share. This would require a mutually agreed-upon value or legal valuation to compensate C and obtain their relinquishment of rights.

These include your mother's death certificate, identity proof, any proof of relationship, passbook, and so on. Further, as an NRI, you would be required to provide a proof of your NRI status, such as your valid passport or visa. After you get such documents ready, you may approach the branch of the bank where the accounts are held, and submit the requisite documents, along with filling the necessary forms. After this, on satisfaction that all the process have been duly followed, the bank would verify the details and thus process for closing the accounts. However, for transferring the funds to your UK Bank account, you would need to submit certain forms to ensure compliance with the Indian tax laws. Such transfer would be made from an NRO or NRE account, depending on the type of accounts your mother held. For this, the bank may charge an amount of fee, and the exchange rates, as on the date of transfer. Besides, as a nominee , you are entitled to claim the funds, but this does not automatically make you the legal heir, if there are other heirs and where distribution would be according to the succession laws of the country.

In case of my mother also, my father's name is mentioned as Name + Chatterjee. Recently my mother's passport application got rejected because my father's passport says Name + Kumar Chattopadhyay and mother's documents are showing her spouse's name is Name + Chatterjee. Can someone please suggest should my father change his name from Name + Kumar Chattopadhyay to Name + Chatterjee in all his documents (which is painstaking as service book records and PPO also need to be changed) or some kind of Alias affidavit is sufficient for future recourse. If Alias affidavit is good enough, does it needed to be published in govt Gazette? Can someone please suggest the best way out as this can become a huge problem for us in future.",

Your father can either change his name officially or provide an alias affidavit. If he opts for an alias affidavit, it should state that \"Kumar Chattopadhyay\" is an alternate name for \"Chatterjee.\" While an alias affidavit can help clarify the situation, it is generally recommended to publish a notification in the Gazette of India to ensure broader legal recognition and avoid future complications. The process involves drafting an affidavit, publishing a notice in at least two newspapers, and obtaining a Gazette notification. This formal procedure will help ensure that all government authorities recognize his name consistently across all documents, thus preventing any issues in the future. Hope this answers your query.",

Since the last 3 years we were extending her visa from india mumbai itself . This year the FRRO is asking for divorce decree from court which i do not have due to reasons mentioned above. The FRRO was extending visa earlier based on the divorce certificate issued by the qazi earlier and now suddenly they are demanding divorce decree. Also please note that i have come to know that my x wife has got married to someone else. My question is how can i get divorce decree from the court . Also will i have to prove to the court that she has now remarried and if so how can i do that. Thanks Nadeem Shaikh",

Even though you have got your marriage dissolved under the provisions of Muslim personal law, since you married a foreigner and are attempting to get her stay extended, you are required to have a proper and legally valid divorce in order to declare your new spouse as your wife. Hence you can file a suit for declaration to declare the dissolution of your marriage in accordance to the provisions of Muslim personal law as valid. The decree passed by the civil court in the declaration suit will come to your rescue to tide over the crisis.",
            "Dear Client, In the Present Scenario, under the Muslim Personal Law, your divorce through a government authorized Qazi may be valid if the relevant procedural requirements were met, such as the pronouncement of Talaq and observance of the Iddat period. However, there are certain authorities that requires a court-issued divorce decree for recognising the validity of a divorce for administrative purposes. This includes the FRRO, for which, you may have to file a declaration suit in the family court under the Family Courts Act, seeking recognition for your divorce as being valid, under the Muslim Personal Law. However, for the same, supporting evidence has to be provided, including the Qazi-issued divorce certificate, an affidavit detailing the divorce process, and, the proof such as wedding pictures, invitations, or any affidavits from the witnesses. Once the relevant family court issues a decree validating the divorce decree, you may submit the same to the FRRO so as to extend the same to your spouse X's visa as well. Additionally, it is necessary that you ensure the requirements under the Foreign Marriage Act is also complied with. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",

            "There isn't much information about proof of protected tenancy rights under the Pagdi system in Mumbai before 1985, but here's some information about the Pagdi system and tenancy rights: The Pagdi system is a type of tenancy where a tenant pays a lump sum to the landlord, known as the pagdi, and then pays a small rent. The pagdi represents the tenant's tenancy rights, which can be passed on to heirs or sold to another person. However it is pertinent that you possess even the old rental agreement or the property tax paid receipts. T he electricity consumption bills are not vital or concrete evidence to decide the tenancy under pagdi system of that period.",
            "Dear Client, In the Present Scenario, you were advised that if you have any official proof of something before 1985, then you may come under the protected tenancy rights. Further, you do not possess any rent receipts which are before 1985 but you may procure old electricity bills from the department as the electricity board has not changed yet. You have also stated that you may try to check if you may get some records from the FDA. Herein, Protected tenants under the Indian law, are often given rights to continue residing in the rented property even if the landlord tries to evict them, as long as the tenancy is deemed valid under the provisions of the Rent Control Law. With respect to the proof prior to 1985, if your tenancy existed before that time, your rights might still be valid under the relevant laws. With respect to what documents may be used as proof, you may use the old electricity bills, FDA or other public records, relevant tax records, court orders or the rent agreement. However, here, the tenant is seeking to claim for protected rights, then the onus of proof lies on the tenant to prove that, they have been continuously occupying the premises, paying rent, and not evicted by the landlord. For the same, old documents, before 1985, may be used to strengthen your case. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute."

A legal notice is a formal communication sent by one party to another, indicating a grievance and seeking remedy before taking legal action.

It serves as a final warning and a precursor to litigation, giving the recipient an opportunity to rectify the issue, negotiate, or prepare for legal proceedings. Understanding the importance of a legal notice is crucial, as its implications are significant for both parties involved. A legal notice acts as a tool for amicable settlement. It opens a channel for negotiation, avoiding the lengthy and expensive litigation process.

Q2. if my wife doesn't come or agree for 2nd motion violating our MOU clause then what is legal remedy for me to enforce her for 2nd motion? Please share your expert advise on above questions. Thanks, Mohammad",
        "answers": [
            "Mohammad bhai, assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh! you need to file a separate petition like you did the first time for getting the 2nd motion conducted. The process: If your wife doesn't turn up for the 2nd motion, you may file a contempt petition against her and claim the penalty as stipulated in the MOU as mandated by the Rajat v. Rupali judgement. Good luck!",
            "No separate case has to be filed 2) both parties have to file affidavit 3) if your wife does not attend court the. Adjournment would be granted 3) if wife remains absent your petition would be dismissed",
            "Yes. After passing of order in first motion allowing first motion second motion petition is to be filed as a fresh case mentioning details of first motion with order passed in first motion and thereafter, same procedure as was held in first motion is to be followed. If wife does not cooperate in second motion or does not attend second motion then it also amount to cruelty and only on this ground husband can file fresh case for divorce. Withdrawn cases can slso be restored. Being muslim and if marriage is performed under muslim law then only you can also pronounce talak on each tuhr to wife.",
            "1. 2nd motion is part of the same case and it can not be treated as separate case. 2. The mutual divorce proceeding will fail if your wife refuse to give consent in person repeatedly within 18 months from the date of filing of the mutual consent divorce.",
            "Mohammad bhai, the first motion and the second motion are registered with two separate case numbers, meaning the 2nd petition can't be considered as an interim application, rather a separate case. Had it been an interlocutory application, the second motion would have been filed in the first motion. But these two are two separate cases."

No doubt the salary of government employees are not taken into consideration for computing annual income of the family but the official designation is the barrier or hurdle. Since, as per your contention, you and your spouse are class I officers in the governmental organisations, that too you joined as an officer directly and your spouse was promoted as officer at the age of 30 years, you come under creamy layer hence not eligible for non creamy layer reservation.",
            "You might know that the Commissionerate of Revenue Administration (CRA) has instructed the District Collectors to duly sensitise authorities over issuing the Other Backward Classes (OBC) non-creamy layer certificate to eligible wards of employees serving in public sector undertakings (PSUs).

It means that if income from salaries of the parents of any candidate is more than Rs.4.5 lakh per annum, income from agricultural land is more than Rs.4.5 lakh per annum, but income from other sources (business) is less than Rs.4.5 lakh per annum, the candidate shall not be treated to be falling in creamy layer on the basis of Income/Wealth Test. (ii) The creamy layer status of a candidate is determined on the basis of the status of his parents (Father-mother) and not on the basis of his own status or income or on the basis of status or income or on the basis or status or income of his/her spouse. Therefore, while determining the creamy layer status of a person the status or the income of the candidate himself or of his/her spouse shall not be taken into account.

The OBC certificate consists of two parts – First part indicates that the concerned person belongs to a community listed as OBC. The second part indicates that the candidate does not fall in the creamy layer.

Understanding the importance of a legal notice is crucial, as its implications are significant for both parties involved. A legal notice acts as a tool for amicable settlement.

Yes, the rental agreement executed by the tenant's wife is valid as long as she has the authority to sign the agreement on behalf of the family and the terms are agreed upon by both parties (you and the tenant). It’s common for the wife to sign on behalf of the family, especially if she is managing the household. b. Witness signatures: Yes, the rental agreement should ideally have witness signatures. Typically, it should include two independent witnesses who are not parties to the agreement. The witness can be anyone who is not directly involved in the contract, but ideally, they should be reliable individuals (friends, neighbors, or professionals). If the tenant's husband signs as a witness, it could be seen as a conflict of interest, so it's better to have an independent third party sign as a witness. Leave and License Agreement: In summary, the agreement signed by the tenant's wife is valid, but it’s best to have independent witnesses, and it’s advisable to seek a professional format for the Leave and License agreement.",

If the eight acres of land satisfies (1) above, then it's called ancestral property. 3. Based on above if it falls within the bracket of ancestral property, then he could not have given such land to only one of his sons. 4. If it were to be ancestral property, then the other brothers and sisters can challenge it in the competent Court to get their individual shares.",
            "It is not ancestral land Father can give land to one of his pms by executing gift deed",
            "Dear Client, In the Present Scenario, the 8 acres of land in question, are inherited by your father from his adoptive mother, and is hence not considered as an ancestral property, as such property refers to those passed through at least four generations of male lineage. Hence, this may be considered as a self-acquired property of your father, and therefore, he had an absolute right to transfer it to one of his sons, either through a gift, sale, or any other means. According to the Hindu Laws, a person has complete control over their self-acquired property, i.e., your father could legally give the land to one son without needing the consent of the other heirs. However, if the transfer was done in an improper way, without following proper legal documentation works, the other brothers and sisters may challenge the transfer in court. The same may be challenged on grounds of fraud, coercion, or mental incapacity. However, if the transfer has been done as a gift or through a will, there may be no challenge raised to the property ownership or transfer. On the other hand, if your father had passed away, without writing a will, the remaining heirs could seek their share of the property. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute.",
            "In this situation, the nature of the land (ancestral or self-acquired) is critical. Since your father received the 8 acres from his adopted mother, it is likely considered self-acquired property, not ancestral. Ancestral property typically passes down undivided through four generations and must remain intact through successive generations, which does not seem to apply here since the land came to him through adoption. As the property is considered self-acquired, your father had the legal right to transfer it to one son in 1973. However, if the transfer was not done with free consent or if there were any irregularities in the process, other siblings could potentially challenge the transfer in court. You may consult a lawyer to explore whether there’s any legal ground to question the validity of the transfer, but a claim on this land may be difficult if all legal protocols were followed and the property is deemed self-acquired. For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy. Hope you find the information helpful. You are free to contact me for further discussion.If you could spare two minutes of your time to write a review, It would be really grateful and very happy to read it. Thank you. Shubham Goyal",
            "No, it is not ancestral property, it becomes your father's own and absolute property hence he can transfer the same to any person of his choice and by any mode of transfer. The proposed challenge by the other siblings will not be tenable in law."

They kept making phone calls so to avoid headache I paid off 85% of the total amount which they said was principal. Now after two weeks even after promising to not bother me again that guy is calling me and forcing me to pay the remaining amount. He is threatening me that he would come to my home again if I don't pay by 2 PM etc. I have his phone call recordings where he had clearly said multiple times that he would close my account if I pay off 85%. I contacted kotak customer care and they say and they gave it to some agency and they don't have the number of the agency and told me to go to branch. I told this to the goon but he says that he is the person in-charge and trying extort money from me. He hasn't given me any document regarding my loan outstanding or any settlement plan. All this torture after I have paid the 85% that he asked for.",

Under the Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act, 1972, all apartment owners are entitled to equal rights over common areas, and maintenance charges should ideally be shared equally, not based on unit size. First, review your society's bylaws to see if they specify equal maintenance charges. If they do, this could support your case. You may also file a complaint with the Registrar of Societies against the association for non-compliance with the Act. If no action is taken, consider escalating this through a writ petition to the High Court. If informal resolutions fail, you can file a civil suit against the society for unfair maintenance fees. Additionally, if you believe your initial case was misinterpreted legally, consult a property lawyer about appealing to a higher court. Given that penthouse owners are a minority in your society, collective action may be necessary to influence changes. Ensure you keep thorough documentation of all communications and payments. Hope this answers your query.",

In that period, a registered gift deed or other formal documentation was required to transfer property ownership effectively. You can file a suit to set aside this unregistered transfer. File a Partition Suit: You may file a partition suit, naming your brother and any other legal heirs of your grandfather as parties. This would request a legal division of the property, and the court could examine the validity of your brother’s claim. Consider Limitation Periods: Be mindful of the limitation period, as significant time has passed. However, since you became aware of the transaction only recently, you might argue that the limitation period should begin from your discovery of the issue. Seek Injunction: To prevent your brother from selling or transferring the property, you can request an injunction restraining him from doing so while the suit is pending. Property Classification: Since the property was inherited by your grandmother from her husband, it would likely be considered her personal property, not ancestral.

        "full_text": "Guidance in Obtaining a Current Dated Court Decree. Good day. I am seeking guidance regarding court decree OS xxx/2001 issued by the Subordinate Judge Court in Erode in 2001. This decree arranged a mutual property exchange between myself (the plaintiff) and my father (the defendant), involving two properties (A Schedule & B Schedule). I was a minor at that time, and unfortunately, my father was unable to register the decree within the stipulated period. Now, 23 years later, the decree remains unregistered, and my father passed away on January 9, 2023. The sub-registrar’s office has informed me that I need a current dated court decree to proceed with registration. I would appreciate your advice on the following queries: 1. How can I apply for a current dated court decree? 2. Should I apply at the same Subordinate Judge Court in Erode, or should I approach a higher court, such as the Madras High Court? 3. Since the defendant is deceased, is the presence of the legal heirs necessary for this process? 4. What steps can I take if the other legal heirs refuse to cooperate in obtaining a current dated court decree, potentially to avoid registration? Your guidance on these matters would be invaluable in helping me secure the unregistered property.",
        "answers": [
            "Sir, you should move to the same Hon'ble Court, which passed the decree in your favour. You may file for execution of decree by making the Legal Representatives of your deceased father as defendants citing reference of the previous decree passed. This should serve your purpose. Please note that it would be an execution, so the objections of the legal heirs would not matter as it is not a trial rather an execution. Had they have any objection, they would have opposed the same during the trial back in 2001. Good luck!",
            "You won’t get current dated court decree as decree has been passed on 2001 2) notice has to be issued to legal heirs",
            "old RECORD, MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. Try in same court which passed the decree.",
            "1. As Decree of Court never expire unless there is mention a limitation period during which the Decree should be executed ,hence you cannot get the same decree on the current date. - However, you can apply for getting certified copy of the said Decree from the same Court with present date. 2. The same Court can only issue the same. 3. No, You can contact a local lawyer for getting the same. 4. If you are in the said property since last 23 years , then you can be declared the legal owner on the ground of adverse possession.",
            "There is no concept of current decree or old decree when the case has already been decided and there is no appeal pending. The sub registrar might have informed you that since you have not filed an execution petition within 12 years from the date of decree, he may say that the same would be barred by limitation. However, if the sub registrar was not impleaded as a party then the decree is not binding on them, but you can file an application before court to get the mutually agreed partition decree registered through court. If the court is also under the opinion that the same is barred by limitation then you can file a suit for declaration to declare your title based on the decree passed in favor of your father and in that you can implead the sub registrar as a necessary party and seek direction to the sub registrar to register the property title to your name as per procedures of law. You can contact your own lawyer for following it up or can engage the services of a new lawyer also"

He used to stay in different locations because routine transfers. In 2021 my father decided to take share of his property and called all his brothers. then he found that 4 of his brothers have taken ownership of lands. for this the procedure they followed is they had approached tahsildar office and gave a consent letter in which their grandmother of my father has mentioned she is transferring the ownership to my uncles.

But their one-line answer was their grandmother did not want to give you property. (But the fact is my father is mostly loved person from his grandmother) between 2020 to 2023 my uncles transferred some land to one of their sisters. and nothing to the other sister as she don't had good relationship with all (she died in 2019, and she has 4 children) this cheating by his brothers hurt my father. Because of his illness and this reason (cheating by his brothers) he passed away in FEB 2023 now when i ask my uncles they reply me saying you have share only in one survey number which has 7 acers is still in the name of grandparents of my father My family feeling cheated by our uncles. I personally feeling humiliated for the way my father was treated by his 4 brothers Are all those handwritten transfer documents (from grandmother to my uncles) which are now the part of revenue départements can be treated as legal? What is the exact procedure of gift deed. In which office it has to be registered? Can My grandfather transfer 8 acres of land (which he got from adopted mother) to one of my uncles? Orally my uncles are saying your father has got his share when our father was alive. But when asked what my father has got, they don't have any answers. What to do negate this claim of theirs? Being low on self-respect are there any legal options available to my family ?",
        "answers": [
            "1) transfer can be done only by registered gift deed 2) transfer from grand mother to uncles is not valid 3) gift deed has to be registered in sub registrar office 4) file suit for partition to claim equal share in 73 acres 5) seek orders to set aside fraudulent transfer done in uncles name 6) seek injunction restraining sale of land by uncles",
            "The deed is only valid if it’s validly stamped furthermore only if the transfer has valid rights to transfer the said property to the transferee",
            "Legal Status of Handwritten Transfers: Handwritten property transfers to your uncles may not be legally valid without proper registration. Gift Deed Procedure: Transfers require a registered gift deed at the Sub-Registrar’s Office with appropriate fees. Grandfather's Right to Transfer: If your grandfather's 8 acres are ancestral, he must consider heirs’ rights before transferring. Challenge Unverified Claims: Request proof if your uncles claim your father “received his share.” Lack of evidence weakens their stance. Legal Options: You may have grounds for a partition or declaration suit to secure your family’s rightful share. Consult a property lawyer to review documents and assist with legal action. For detailed, personalized advice, consider a phone consultancy. Hope you find the information helpful. You are free to contact me for further discussion.If you could spare two minutes of your time to write a review, It would be really grateful and very happy to read it. Thank you. Shubham Goyal",
            "Firstly, you gather information about all properties, then you collect the evidences of the transfer of properties to various people and see what you have lost by the reported false inheritance by other uncles. After that you may file a suit for partition and make a claim for your rightful share in the properties. A transfer of an immovable property by an unregistered deed is not legally valid.",
            "Dear Client, In the Present Scenario, there involves complex property issues and inheritance disputes as well. Herein, the issue revolves around the property that your grandfather, Shankrayya, inherited from his adoptive mother, Gouramma. Since your your grandfather was adopted after her husband’s death, it must be determined as to whether the adoption made made legally under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, as an illegal adoption may not grant complete legal rights to the ancestral property. With respect to the transfer of property by your grandmother to your uncle, if the same had been with a written consent letter, in presence of witnesses, but without a proper registration of the gift deed, the transfers may not be legally valid under Indian law. This is because the gift deeds generally require registration with the Sub-Registrar and the payment of stamp duty. It is hereby suggested that, you may file a civil suit for partition for claiming a rightful share in the property under the Indian Law, or seek a declaration that the transfers were illegal due to lack of registration. Here, if the documents that your uncles' had used were not executed in accordance to law, the same may be considered invalid in the eyes of law. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute."

        "full_text": "Legal action against franchisee for business losses, fraud negligence, and data theft. Dear Kanoon.com Lawyers/Team, I am seeking legal advice on pursuing action against a franchisee in, India, who has directly contributed to substantial financial losses for my UK-based business. The Hyderabad franchise was officially registered as a franchise and was responsible for back-office operations, including sales, marketing, customer support, payment collections, and managing critical customer data on behalf of the UK company. Recently, the franchisee has become unresponsive, switching off their phones and seemingly absconding. In addition, they took important data (such as booking forms) from our shared systems and deleted much of this data, further impacting our ability to manage customer claims and finances. I have several questions regarding possible legal actions and the relevant sections under Indian law to address this serious situation: Grounds for Legal Action: What legal actions can I initiate in India for breach of contract, negligence in duties, potential fraud, and data theft, given that they failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to the UK company and are now absconding? Relevant Sections and Acts: Under which specific sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or civil contract law can I file a case? Are there specific provisions for: Negligence in fulfilling back-office duties (including customer support and collections) that led to financial harm? Absconding, fraud, and potential data theft, given their failure to transfer funds, safeguard critical data, or continue operations? Breach of contract, as they did not fulfill their agreed responsibilities, including preserving essential customer data? Process for Legal Action: Could you outline the process for filing a complaint or lawsuit against an absconding franchisee in Hyderabad, and what evidence will be crucial to support my case? Possibility of Criminal Charges: Given the franchisee’s unresponsiveness, deletion of data, and the resulting financial impact, would this case qualify for criminal charges? If so, could charges like criminal breach of trust (Section 406), cheating (Section 420), or data theft apply under the IPC? Recovery of Financial Damages: What options do I have to recover the financial losses and customer data that were compromised due to their negligence? Could the court order damages, restitution, or even require the retrieval of critical data if it can be located? Steps for Immediate Action: Since the franchisee is absconding and has deleted data, is there any immediate legal action (such as sending a legal notice or filing a First Information Report (FIR)) you would recommend to formally initiate the case, protect my interests, and prevent further loss? I would greatly appreciate any guidance you can provide on the above questions, as well as recommendations for the best course of action given the franchisee’s absconding status, deletion of data, and my priority to recover losses.

On the other hand, IPC Sections 406, 408, and 409 pertain to criminal breach of trust by various categories of individuals, including public servants, clerks, or servants. IPC Section 405 defines criminal breach of trust as dishonest misappropriation or conversion of entrusted property for personal use. IPC Section 403 defines dishonest misappropriation as the wrongful conversion of movable property. If even one ingredient of an offence under the Indian Penal Code is missing in the act which has been made punishable under the special statute, the Indian Penal Code section will not be excluded and still can be resorted to albeit, the provisions of section 71 of the Indian Penal Code and section 26 of the General Clauses Act Therefore your options are to; i) lodge a criminal complaint with the local police station where the suspect is believed to reside or was residing; ii) You can ascertain the losses you suffered and can file a recovery suit to recover the losses and damages through civil court too simultaneously iii) For breach of contract conditions you can file a civil suit for specific relief too.

The ₹3 deduction you see is TDS on the winnings, not employment income. It’s automatically deducted when your winnings cross a certain threshold, so it won’t affect your employment status. Form 26AS: Form 26AS is a consolidated statement of tax deducted, tax collected, and advance tax paid. TDS from online gaming platforms will appear here, but it’s listed under “Other Sources,” not “Salary.” This ensures it is clear it’s not employment income. Tax Implications: Income from Dream11 falls under income from other sources when you file your tax return, and it is not considered salary income or part of dual employment. In summary, this TDS deduction from Dream11 is unrelated to dual employment and simply reflects tax on your gaming winnings. You should report it as income from other sources when you file your tax return.",
            "It does not come under dual employment you have just played some games and earned some income",
            "It is not dual employment",
            "Dream 11 is considered as a skilled game and not an employment therefore there is no question of dual employment, don't worry due to an imaginary concept.",
            "Any income derived out of such games or any other remuneration are subjected to tax deducted at source, hence don't spread your imagination on any unfounded concept."

At last I applied for survey and survey person also told there was no encroachment in his site, and construction was within boundary. But surveyor didn’t gave any report to me, orally told me. I conveyed same to Mr.x also. Still he was not satisfied, gave complaint in panchayat office, municipality, sp office, collector office also. Panchayat office and muncipality office also realised there was no encroachment and told us to continue our work. Recently by using tenant rights, started complaining that construction was not going according to plan approval.deviations were there. Deviations I made is, I made a provision for lift, which was not in plan. Each floor I constructed 2 homes, instead of one as per approved plan. I am construction only g+2 even though approval is g+3 In plan there was gap along the boundaries, while construction little bit difference was there in gap.

Legal Procedure to Cancel a Gift Deed Given to the Daughter by the Mother 2. Civil Court or RDO Court Due to Senior Citizen Status 3. Non-joinder of Necessary Parties 4. Validity of the Gift Deed Revoked Solely by Your Grandmother 5. Applicability of Section 23 of the Senior Citizens Act, 2007 6. Injunction Between Siblings in Family Property Disputes 7. Adding Your Grandmother as a Witness or Filing for Revocation 8. Use of Web History and MRO Office Records for Counter 9. Absence of Passbook or Documents by the Daughter In summary, it seems appropriate to proceed by challenging the gift deed in the RDO court due to her senior status and invoking Section 23 of the Senior Citizens Act.

I have been a victim of domestic abuse and dowry abuse and since has been living apart from my husband(he lives in another state) since 15 years.I filed for a maintanence during that time according to his salary which was 40,000 every month. and the maintenance amount provided as ordered by the court (2nd addl senior judge) in our state is rupees 7000 every month to me and my son accordingly in 2008 . So here comes the problem my husband works at a central government organisation and has recieved many promotions since then and has had increment of salary too many times but our advocate (for some reason idk?) didn't bother to file an enhancement even after repeated requests from me and my father up until 2019. In the year 2019 his salary has increased to rupees 1,70,000 a month and also he owned a few flats in other states. I also battled lukemia in the year 2016 which costed a hefty amount for treatment (24 lakh to be precise)and also with my son' increasing educational expenses every year we filed for an enhancement of maintenance to 70k per month to both of us in the state where we are but our lawyer instead of filing it with the (2nd addl senior judge) in continuation of the older case he filed in 3rd munisiff court (lower court than the 2nd one )and he said it is alright if it's filed anywhere. After 6 years of battling and we submitting all property documents he owned and his income certificate we weren't awared the maintenance ( we were only given a meagre increment of ₹10k per month). And also he is not upholding the monthly maintenance judgement given in 2008 and not sending us even the ₹7000 every month we always have to file an executive petition if he doesn't send the amount and that always takes 3YEARS to get just 1 YEAR of amount 60k to be precise after all the cross arguments and adjournments of the court, So I asked my advocate to send a letter to the Central Government organisation my husband works in reminding him the 2008 judgement to pay us regularly only to not recieve any response from them. I called them they transferred my call to the law department only to say to me that he is denying to pay it and it seems he only pays after we file an ep (intentionally wasting time and avoiding us) and also his salary is now 3,50,000 per month he has gone to a very high position too along with bonuses of 8 lakh. We also filed for an appeal for enhancement here in the state where we live in. So what do you think I should do? Do you think our lawyers at fault here? He won't pay heed to what we say and fumbled before the judge when she asked for some decisions as to why he didn't continue 1) continue with the appeal in district court in the state where we live ? 2) change the lawyer and transfer it to the state where my father works apparently theres some person inside who provided us with his salary certificate last time(he works at that organisation too)and he is willing to help us but he is asking to file a formal draft to him",

You can go ahead and deposit the cheque in bank and by only presenting the cheque in bank, it can add pressure on him. Pro Note is valid evidence to prove your case in Cour of law. No one is above the law. Let me be clear - no one is above the law. Not a politician, not a priest, not a criminal and not even a police officer. We are all accountable for our actions. As per guidelines of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the validity period of cheque from the date of issue is 3 months. A cheque bounce, also known as a dishonored cheque, occurs when a cheque issued by someone (drawer) cannot be cleared due to insufficient funds or any other reason in their account. In India, the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) governs cheque bounce cases and Cheque Bounce Case Procedure pursuing legal action. After the cheque gets dishonoured, a legal notice should be sent by way of R.P.A.D. to the drawer of the cheque through an advocate within 30 days from the date of the cheque return memo. Demanding the amount of the cheque within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice. When the drawer fails to repay the amount within 15 days from the service of the notice, the receiver can file a criminal complaint against the drawer u/s 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The complaint must be filed before the Magistrate within 30 days after the expiration of 15 days from the service of notice. The affidavit is filed and attached to the complaint. The Court examines the original documents and checks for validity and limitation of the complaint filed. The complaint can also be filed by the power of attorney of the complainant. After satisfaction, the court issues a summons against the accused, and the case is tried as a summary criminal proceeding. When the accused presents himself before the court, the court asks the accused to furnish surety and to submit bail bonds, in order to make certain that the accused will remain present on every date of the proceedings. The plea of the accused is recorded, and particulars are framed. At the stage of evidence, the complainant files all the original documents before the court, followed by an examination in chief and cross examination of the complainant. The complainant can give further witnesses if he wants to; otherwise, the evidence of the complainant is closed. Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, provides presumptions in favour of a complaint. Accused can rebut the presumption by taking a probable defence. After competition of complainant’s evidence, statement u/s 313 of Code of Criminal Procedure, of accused is recorded. Accused can give his witnesses if he wants to. After closing of evidence of both sides, arguments are heard by both parties and conducted by their respective counsels. Then the court pronounces judgement in open court. Furthermore, a criminal complaint can also be filed for early action and to build pressure on him. After the amendment of 2002, the term of imprisonment was extended to 2 years, or the fine, which may extend to double the amount of the cheque or both. You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification with documents."

            "A cheque bounce case can be initiated against the drawer of the cheque and the guarantor cannot be implicated in the cheque bounce case if he has not signed the cheque. If your relative has issued his personal cheque towards repayment of borrowed amount, then he should be worried about it because he would be liable for the offence of bouncing the cheque. In that case, it is not understood that how come bank is coming down to accept the amount reduced by more than 50% of the liable amount? If the bank is offering to withdraw the cheque bounce case on payment of the reduced amount then he can get it done through lok adalat by signing the terms in that context which the bank cannot withdraw at a later stage. Whatever, it is advisable that it should be clearly documented to avoid future litigation in this regard If it is a civil money recovery suit and if your relative had given any property as collateral security then as a guarantor he need to be worried about the non repayment of loan amount by the borrower because the bank has to first exhaust the recovery options from the borrower first."

            "Contempt of court refers to the act of interfering with the administration of justice, which can take various forms and may result in the improper execution of justice. It is considered a serious offense that can lead to imprisonment, and it involves making false statements or interfering with the judicial proceedings. The main difference between civil contempt and criminal contempt in India is that civil contempt is a violation of a court order, while criminal contempt is an act that interferes with the administration of justice. In India, the punishment for civil contempt of court is as follows: Simple imprisonment for up to six months, A fine of up to two thousand rupees, and Both. The accused can be discharged or the punishment can be remitted if they apologize to the satisfaction of the court. The apology must be bona fide and not qualified or conditional Criminal contempt of court is different from civil contempt of court, which is usually used to enforce legal directives like child support payments. Criminal contempt of court is intended to punish misconduct, while civil contempt is intended to compel compliance. The punishment for criminal contempt of court is a fine of up to Rs 2,000, or simple imprisonment for up to 6 months, or both. However, this limit only applies to the High Courts, and the Supreme Court has more discretion in what punishment to give",

With respect to the query as to whether the same petitioner who filed the civil contempt, will it be possible to file another criminal contempt case and pursue both cases together, it can be noted that, the same can be done as there is no bar to present a civil and a criminal case for the same fact situation.

            "1.In civil contempt cases, it is possible for other affected parties to join the case, if these parties can show that the actions of the said statutory authority have caused them direct harm and that their interests are linked, - Further, they can move an application before the Court for become a party in the case. 2. Yes, the same petitioner who filed the civil contempt case can also file a separate criminal contempt petition if there are grounds for such a claim.",
            "These cases are very common in various Courts of India and Supreme Court of India. I can understand your concern in this regard. Third party (similarly affected) can be impleaded in the case. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has emphasized that Section 20 applies to civil and criminal contempts and would also apply to the contempt committed on the face of High Court or the Supreme Court or even Subordinate Courts. Therefore, with regard the instituting both together, the documents is to be examined. In an inter-party proceeding, orders of the Court bind only the parties to such proceedings. Therefore, violation of such orders by any of the parties to the proceedings may amount to contempt of Court, punishable in terms of the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. However, there may be instances where the violation/ disregard of Court's order results not only from the conduct of the parties to the proceedings, rather, from the conduct of persons totally unrelated thereto (\"third person\"). Under such circumstances, providing immunity to third person on pure technical grounds that the orders of Court bind only parties to the proceedings, would amount to permitting indirect assault on the majesty and supremacy of judiciary, which the Courts are bound to protect. Law on third party liability in contempt proceedings in India is primarily an adaptation of the principles of English Law. One of the earliest English cases discussing the liability of third party in contempt proceedings is that of Seaward v. Paterson, (1897) 1 Ch. 545. The Hon'ble Chancery Division, while acknowledging the difference between the person bound by order of Court and a person, though not bound by such order, but conducting himself in the manner so as to obstruct the course of justice, held, \"In the one case the party who is bound by the injunction is proceeded against for the purpose of enforcing the order of the Court for the benefit of the person who got it. In the other case the Court will not allow its process to be set at naught and treated with contempt.\" Similarly, Lord Denning in Acrow (Automation) Ltd. v. Rex Chainbelt Inc., (1971) 3 All ER 1175 held, \"The Court has jurisdiction to commit for contempt person, not a party to the action who knowing of an injunction, aids and abets the defendant in breaking it.\" The aforementioned principles were adopted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sita Ram v. Balbir alias Bali, (2017) 2 SCC 456, while imposing liability on third persons, aiding and abetting the contemnor in flouting the orders of the Hon'ble Court. The Hon'ble Madras High Court in Vidya Charan Shukla v. Tamil Nadu Olympic Association & Anr., AIR 1991 Mad. 323, while carrying out an exhaustive review of the case laws on the subject, observed, \"We can see thus clearly that the Courts in India invariably accepted the law applied in England and found (1) a party to the suit if he had notice or knowledge of the order of the Court and (2) a third party or a stranger, if he had aided or abetted the violation with notice or knowledge of the order of injunction guilty of civil contempt and otherwise found a third party guilty of criminal contempt if he has been found knowingly obstructing implementation of its order or direction..\" Conclusively, mere absence of law specifically providing for the liability of third party in contempt proceedings has not acted as a deterrent for the Courts to reprimand the violators of its orders, though, not specifically named therein or expressly bound by it. In fact, through the process of adoption and traversing the rugged terrains through years, Courts have developed a mechanism wherein no violator of its order/ injunction is left unpunished, even though not a party to a proceeding before Court. Clearly an act of violation of order of the order of Court or interfering with the administration of justice by third person amounts to contempt by such third person. As Lord Justice Eveleigh in Z LTD. v. A-Z AND AA-LL, [1982] Q.B. 558 observed, \"It is true that his conduct may very often be seen as possessing a dual character of contempt of court by himself and aiding and abetting the contempt by another, but the conduct will always amount to contempt of court by himself. It will be conduct which knowingly interferes with the administration of justice by causing the order of the court to be thwarted.\" Detailed discussion is required in such cases with relevant documents. You may contact my secretary to connect with me for clarification."

This was taken for the purpose of completing your research project in UK. Additionally, you asked for a 6 month leave extension for your research project or accept your resignation if they cannot grant you leave. Subsequently, on December 6, 2023, the University directed you to submit one month salary, to process the resignation acceptance further. Your query here is whether you can withdraw your resignation if you have not submitted the one-month pay yet. Herein, firstly, it is suggested that you look into the University's rules on taking extraordinary leave, and how long the same can be extended. Further, you can apply for the extension of leave formally, by providing the necessary documentation for the same. However, not returning to the University, either without paying one-month fee for resignation or without an approved extension, may result in being treated as unauthorised and may lead to an automatic resignation from the job. If you wish to withdraw your request, it is recommended that the same is done through a formal request to the university. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute."

Elder brother has to pass through that road to his farm land. Elder brother gave more than 1 acre of land to the younger brother towards road as a compensation. As a result elder brother got 7.38 acres and younger brother got 9 acres. Since that road was already existing, the road details were not mentioned in the family settlement. After division, the younger brother closed the existing road during October 2015 and provided an alternate road which passes through the lands of 4 different farmers without the consent of the elder brother, as he was away from the village since he was an employee. At the end of 2015, when the elder brother visited the village, he found that an alternate road was provided to reach his farm land. At that time the elder brother asked his younger brother to restore the then existing road and the younger brother readily agreed but not restored. Meanwhile, the younger brother died during March, 2016. Elder brother continued to use the alternate road. Recently there are disputes over the alternate road, as one of the farmer is making some objections. Elder brother wanted to restore the then existed road prior to 2016 but the younger brother’s family are objecting to it. They say that nothing is mentioned about road in the settlement agreement. Therefore they will not restore that road. There are several witness to the fact that the road existed as on 29.12.1994 because on that day the funeral procession passed through that road. Secondly, there are several witnesses to the fact that the father’s funeral procession had passed through the same road.

During my wife's cross examination she had admitted that she had never made any complaint and not filed any court case against me till 2021 in Delhi while her stay with me in Delhi at my rented accommodation. Question- Whether I can take any ground for the same for why my wife had filed the false maintenance case against me in Haryana at her parents home city on 21/12/2021 instead of in Delhi since she was living in Delhi on date of case filing. My wife had mentioned that she does not know any date and time for any domestic violence done by me and my family members, it means all her allegations are vague allegations.

It amounts to perjury 2) you can take the plea that maintenance case should have been filed in city wherein wife was residing at time of filing of maintenance case 3) it will not help you in maintenance case as you have to pay her maintenance if she is unable to maintain herself 4) if wife has misled the court and has been working she is not entitled to any maintenance. 5) petitioner who comes to court with un clean hands is not entitled to any reliefs",
            "If your wife is proved to have given false statement on oath before court then it can be considered as an act of perjury. If she's found to have suppressed her employment and salary income and if you prove that then she may not be eligible for maintenance. You can strongly argue that she has approached court with unclean hands by suppressing the vital facts and played fraud on court for wrongful gains of ineligible maintenance and get her case dismissed.",

Perjury in India is not an remedy which is often entertained by court. the leniency of the court towards litigants including impleaded admission that most of the allegations are frivolous , cases under perjury often does not succeed. Though there is no harm in trying for the same, it is unlikely to give positive results. 2. The petitioner is maintenance case being the ' dominant litus', mere mismatch in her evidence as regards her residence would ot damages her case. 3. Summons her employee then forcing her to bring records against merit of her case. 4. If you file case for perjury then these would help you.",
            "Take the plea that these photos were uploaded by wife in her Facebook and other accounts 2) maintenance-if any would be awarded from date of application made by wife 3) you can take the plea that wife allegations are vague and devoid of particulars",
            "If she refuses to admit the photos or any other type social media evidence calling them as fake or fabricated then the court will not permit you to mark them as exhibits, in that case you have no other option than to summon the employment details by sending a notice to her employer through court to establish your case. The maintenance orders is always passed from the date of application. You first prove that she is employed hence not eligible for maintenance. As far as the jurisdiction is concerned she can claim maintenance for the period she was living with you in the same house also or she might state that since she went to her parents house after dispute with you hence filed the case from that place but subsequently she came and live in your house for a short period. Therefore that will not be a very good ground to deny the maintenance to her, however you can state that she has not approached the court with clean hands and is full of lies and false allegations. The case is based on your strong arguments and merits."

We are two brothers and two sisters. I am the youngest one in my family. Two sisters and eldest brother are married. My middle brother and I am still un married. I build three shop and one floor completely from my money which costs around 15 Lakh. I have also paid all my father’s loan (taken from people) along with my mother’s medical and personal expenses. My mother had fallen severely ill four months after my father’s demise. She spent almost a month in a private hospital including 21 days in ICU. After that she is completely on medicine and so far she has been admitted to hospital for four times whenever she is serious. So these expenses are huge and totally spent by me. Later my both brothers took money from me to do business (2 lakh eldest one and approx 1lakh middle one). Adding all I have spent more than 40 Lakh in these stuffs. Now my eldest brother and his wife has started fighting with us every now and then and making difficult to even visit home for few days. I work in Mumbai. My home is constructed in such a way that it can’t be split and because of bad behaviour of my eldest brother and his wife, entire family’s peace is lost. Somehow I am feeling like they are trying to hold middle brother and my marriage talks so that they could get the whole property. I am 36 and my middle brother is 38 and still there is no effort from their side about our marriage. Whenever such talks goes on, they start fighting and because of these nuisance my mother gets sick again and hospitalised. I bear all medical and personal expenses of my mother.

I am seeking legal advice regarding the partition of an agricultural land property left behind by my late father, who passed away 13 years ago. My father inherited this property from my grandfather. I will provide you with the details of the current situation and my query: The property in question was inherited by my father from my grandfather. After my father’s passing (without a will), my family and I are considering executing a partition deed. My family consists of five legal heirs: my mother (who is still alive), my three sisters, and myself. We are planning to divide the property equally with each receiving a 20% share (20% for each sister, 20% for my mother, and 20% for myself). However, my 2nd sister is demanding a 40% share of the property with the false claim that our father, during his lifetime, promised to give her 40% of the property. The rest of the family (myself, my mother, and my other two sisters) do not agree with this demand, and we believe this claim is unsubstantiated. In light of this, I would like to know if it is legally valid to execute a partition deed between my mother, my 1st and 3rd sisters, and myself, excluding my 2nd sister's share for the time being. Additionally, if such a partition deed is executed without my 2nd sister's consent or involvement, will I have absolute rights over my 20% share in the property? I would also like to understand the legal consequences of excluding my 2nd sister and whether she can challenge the partition in the future. I kindly request your guidance on the following: The legal validity of a partition deed executed without the consent of one legal heir (my 2nd sister). The steps we can take to either resolve this dispute or proceed with the partition while protecting my and my family's rights. Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your advice on the best way to proceed. Best regards,",

You have no option than to approach court of law with a suit for partition and separate possession your share in the property for all the other four shareholders/legal heirs.

Each loan is treated independently, and the bank may update its policies or assess the risk differently based on a buyer's profile, regulatory changes, or internal procedures. If the bank denies your loan because you do not possess those specific documents you can 1. Clarify the reason why the bank requested to have those documents, and try to solve this problem by discussing alternatives with the bank. 2. Approach the bank grievance redressal system and narrate the inconsistency in the requirement of documents. 3. File a suit in a civil court if the denial causes undue delay or results in pecuniary loss, but more than that, it is usually resorted to when all else fails.

        "full_text": "Regarding one-time settlement of loan with State Bank of India. I am 73 years old, residing in Kollam. This is regarding my loan account with the State Bank of India, for which I availed a loan of INR 35,00,000 at an interest rate of 12.70% on May 15, 2015. I have been diligent in making the loan repayments, especially while I was still in employment in Gulf. Following my retirement in the mid of 2016 and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020-2022, I faced significant challenges that hindered my ability to make regular payments. Despite my best efforts to catch up on my dues, I have been unable to maintain the repayment schedule. Additionally, I have noticed that the bank has been increasing the interest rates (rate of interest increased from 12.70% to 16% by June 2024) which has resulted in the escalation of my Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI). While I have made considerable payments towards my loan, the continuous hike in the interest rates has dramatically affected my net outstanding amount, resulting in substantial dues once again. I sought the help of the SBI top management to consider waiving some interest during the 2022-2023 period. I personally met with AGM, LHO, Trviandrum and AGM, RASMEC, Kottarakkara, and explained my situation. I was informed that there was no possibility of waiving or discounting the interest unless my loan becomes a Non-Performing Asset (NPA). Since June 2023, my wife and I have been experiencing serious health issues. The sudden decline in my wife’s health led to her immediate hospitalization at KIMS Health, Trivandrum, on June 17, 2023, which turned our lives upside down. She was diagnosed with a stroke, resulting in right hemiplegia and aphasia. She was treated and brought back home in a paralyzed state (whole right body). On January 1, 2024, I fell and broke my leg, resulting in fractures of both bones in my right leg. I was treated with ORIF (Open Reduction and Internal Fixation) using bridge plating with a lateral tibial locking plate. Since June 2023, we have been completely dependent on our children for our food and medication. Additionally, they have assisted me in repaying my loan. Overall, I have paid a total of INR 42,45,445 towards my loan as of July 2024. Recently, I have been receiving frequent visits from bank officials, which creates considerable discomfort for us. They often speak harshly and have threatened me with severe consequences. Despite my several attempts to negotiate a full and final settlement of my loan, the accumulated interest continues to increase my liability further. I am completely confused by the intermittent changes in the interest rate since May 2015 from i.e. from 12.70% to 16%. I have emailed my situtation to many big shots of SBI including Deputy General managers. I have requested one time settlement. No one has replied to my email so far but some of the SBI representantives often call me and threaten me of legal proceedings. Kindly advise me a suitable way out.",

            "It appears that you have availed loan at floating rate of interest and not at fixed rate. Therefore, as the index rises the interest rate will raise proportionately. You can try the option to preclose the loan by arranging the money to meet outstanding loan with interest The bank cannot refuse to accept the closure of loan after so many years. If the bank staffs are threatening then you can lodge a criminal complaint against them with local police for legal action. However you cannot take legal action if the bank refuses for one time settlement, alternately you can look for take over loan for lower interest with some other bank.",
            "Have you given any security for the loan kindly clarify if you fail to repay the loan bank will seek to recover the loan amount by auctioning the secured asset 3) if you are unable to repay the loan let it become NPA 4) if you don’t have the means to repay bank would not be able to recover the loan amount with interest",
            "Dear Client, Considering the health and age-related condition and financial condition of your case, it would be a better option to approach the SBI bank for a one-time settlement. According to Indian banking law and RBI guidelines, when the account becomes an NPA on grounds of genuine reasons when the borrowing is not repaid, the bank may provide the option of OTS. However, since your account has not been classified yet as NPA, this might be the reason your plea for the settlement was rejected in the first place. First, you have to ask the bank to restructure the loan considering your health and financial conditions. You can reach the grievance redressal cell of the bank, and lodge a written complaint with the bank regarding how the interest rates on your account are being increased arbitrarily, how your health issues have aggravated, and how things are going financially in the current situation. Also, you must mention to them the amount that has already been paid, which is INR 42,45,445 and make them understand that it is not possible to continue the repayments. If the officials at the bank are persisting with harassment, then report this to the Banking Ombudsman, Reserve Bank of India. The Ombudsman takes complaints on issues related to banking services, including harassment by officers and failure to process your requests appropriately. Other than that, you can even go to court to inform the bank officials of mental harassment and even threats of a lawsuit without first considering good possible solutions. I hope this explanation resolves your doubts effectively. If you still have any further queries regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact us again.",
            "- As per the RBI, the bank should give proper time and offers for the settlement of loan amount., on the ground of health and sudden loss - If, the bank is not agreed to give time, then don’t worry and let them to start legal action against you. - Firstly, the bank will issue demand notice prior to take legal action from the court. You can reply the same after narrating the whole story of medical expenditures and losses. . - Even, if the bank filed a case before the Court, you will have much time to repay the said loan amount and to settle the matter according his present situation. - If bank official/people are harassing, then you can file a complaint against them before the police and higher official as they cannot harass a defaulter to recover the loan amount. - Further, you can file a complaint with the RBI against the bank for not responding your letter."

        "full_text": "Assistance required regarding loan and vehicle seizure issue. I am reaching out for legal advice concerning a situation I am currently facing regarding my personal and car loans. Background: I have a personal loan that was recently written off by the bank due to financial difficulties, and I also have two car loans, one of which is being handled by my brother. The car is registered under my name but used by my brother, who had been paying the EMIs until recently. Unfortunately, my brother missed three consecutive EMIs, which led to the bank seizing the car. The car was seized directly from the road by bank employees, and passengers, including my brother, were left stranded without any prior notice of the seizure. This incident has caused a great deal of inconvenience. Communication with the Bank: I reached out to the bank manager and offered to immediately pay the three outstanding EMIs for the car to have it released. However, the manager refused my offer, stating that due to my personal loan being in default (now written off), I must either: Pay the complete outstanding balance of the personal loan and the three missed EMIs for the car loan, or Settle the entire outstanding amount of the car loan in full to have the car released. The bank also informed me that they would not issue a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for the car until the personal loan is fully cleared, despite my prior discussions about settling the personal loan separately. My Concerns: Seizure Without Prior Notice: The car was seized without any prior notice, and passengers were left on the road, which raises concerns about whether the bank followed the proper legal procedures for repossession. Unreasonable Conditions for Car Release: The bank is linking the release of the car and the issuance of the NOC to the repayment of my personal loan, which seems unjustified given that the car loan and personal loan are separate. can you help me what to do",

Hence, assets cannot be appropriated. Recovery is based on the contract term of dispute resolution and through the process of law, 6) the Patna High Court has said that banks and finance companies cannot use recovery agents to forcefully seize vehicles of customers who have defaulted on car loans, without following the proper procedure under law. 7) you can complain to RBI against the bank",

            "Obtain in writing from bank that car will be released on payment of balance outstanding car loan 2) bank may settle for principal amount and waive interest in case of personal loan as they do not have any collateral security 3) bank can exercise right of lien and use other accounts of defaulter to recover loan amount 4) you need to engage a lawyer for drafting complaint to bank as well as RBI",
            "A bank can seize a vehicle if the borrower defaults on loan repayment EMIs, but they must follow the proper procedure: Lenders typically initiate repossession after 60 to 90 days of missed payments. Lenders must comply with the SARFAESI Act and RBI guidelines. They must also provide reasonable notice to the borrower before selling the asset. Banks and finance companies cannot use recovery agents to forcefully seize vehicles. The Supreme Court has ruled that the recovery process must be in accordance with law and not by use of force. No doubt the financer has a right to take over the possession of the vehicle but the contract agreement does not give authority to the financier to take over the possession of the vehicle forcefully. RBI guidelines have emphasised that repossessions clause in the contract should be legally valid, should comply with the provisions of the Indian Contract Act in letter and spirit and banks should ensure that such repossession clause is clearly brought to the notice of the borrower at the time of execution of the contract. You can issue a legal notice to the bank and demand explanation for their unjustified action and also file a criminal complaint agaisnt the agents who seized the vehicle forcibly citing illegal act by the bank agents",
            "1. The bank may furnish NOC only if the entire outstanding loan including the accrued interest has been fully paid and the loan is fully discharged. 2. If the bank is insisting on repayment of the personal loan then they may not release the car even if you are ready to pay the arrears of EMI amount 3. A loan write-off is when a lender recognises that a loan or debt has become uncollectible and removes it from their financial records as an asset. In other words, the lender acknowledges that they are unlikely to recover the outstanding amount of the loan, and they decide to close the account. However, it doesn't mean the borrower is no longer liable for the debt. The lender can continue to pursue debt recovery through legal action or debt collection agencies. 4. A bank cannot use another account of a defaulter to recover a personal loan unless they follow a legal process. Lenders can only seize a borrower's assets if they have a court order and follow due process. 5. You can contact an advocate either from this forum or outside and engage the services of the chosen advocate on the terms of the chosen advocate"

As a person with 90% blindness, I am looking for clarification on the legal process for challenging CCPD orders.

I reported the incident to my reporting authority within 3 days via email, but no action was taken, and no committee was formed. Instead, after 8 months, I was sent on a punitive transfer, which I believe was in retaliation for reporting the incident.

            "Dear Client, Sorry to hear about your condition. According to the RPwD Act, 2016, while filing an appeal against any order passed by the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD), the act does not consist of an appellate provision to appeal against the CCPD’s order. Thus, the conventional legal treatment would be to move to the higher court by filing a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and praying for judicial review of the CCPD’s decision. This approach is taken when Challenging quasi-judicial orders that do not provide a statutory right of appeal. A writ petition would enable you to appeal the decision on the different grounds such as illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety. The High Court has jurisdiction to consider whether or not the CCPD complied with the law and whether the procedural fairness was complied with or not. CCPD orders are of administrative nature, thus, in case of extreme need you can apply for a writ of certiorari or mandamus depending on the kind of relief you want. In regards to workplace discrimination and retaliation your rights are protected under the RPwD act especially section 20 that deals with nondiscrimination in employment, However,with 90% blindness, finding employment is still a vital challenge. If the CCPD has not provided sufficient relief, the High Court can be contacted for enforcing your rights and for handling the punitive transfer, perhaps for requesting a stay with regard to the transfer in addition to discrimination and retaliation.

Thus s.154B-1 clause (b) defines who is a Joint Member. It only says that the joint member has share right title and interest in the flat jointly. It nowhere says that the order of names has to be the same as in the instrument of transfer. Thus the only requirement is that the joint member should have a share right etc in the flat jointly with another. u/s 154B-4(1) the society can admit ANY person as the joint member. It does not state that only the person whose name stands second in the instrument of transfer [in your case the gift deed] can be admitted as a joint member the voting rights of joint members are also provided in s. 154B-11 (4) thus if the society has communicated its reasons against transfer of membership to the joint names in the order desired by you, then you will have to appeal to the registrar u/s 23(2) and if there is no communication by the society about its refusal to admit the joint members as stated in the application then they would be deemed to become the members of the society by virtue of s.22(2) after the expiry of the statutory period stated therein",
            "Dear Client, Under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and relevant bye-laws, it is the Gift Deed alone that forms the primary document for ownership transfer in a cooperative society which records legal transfer of title. It can be deemed justifiable as the very suggestion by the society to issue the share certificate as mentioned in the Gift Deed is a reflection of the legal status of ownership. The order of the names in the Gift Deed is what reflects the intention of the transferor, and in updating their records, the law compels the society to oblige by the same. While the application form (Appendix 23) allows you to specify the priority of members for listing purposes, for all legal purposes, including ownership, the Gift Deed is paramount. Under the laws governing cooperative housing societies, both are coowners who hold their shares equally, regardless of which one is first and which second on the application form. If the society misreads the application and labels the second-named member as an \"Associate Member,\" they are, in fact, full members with equal rights. If you are still facing problems at any point in the future, remedy may be available through consulting the society registrar or Rule 56 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Rules, dealing with voting rights, co-members' rights, and election procedures. Your option filled in your application form is also important for administrative reasons, though it will not supersede the legal order of ownership established under the Gift Deed. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",
            "The association is right in mentioning that they will record the names in the order of the registered title deed (gift deed), therefore there should not be any issue to dispute the action of the association. As you cannot change the order of names in the gift deed now, it would be better that you accept the law of the association. Whether or not, you both are entitled to a share in the property equally as a right by the virtue of the registered gift deed on both the names. In the event of attending the AGM or participating in an election you may authorize him to act on your behalf."

Thirdly, though there has been an initial acknowledgment made, the same cannot be taken as a agreement under the Contract Act, unless it fulfils all the essential elements of the same, including the addition of forfeiture clause, consequences of non-execution of the agreement, and so on. However, it can be taken as a binding document on both parties, as the same has been entered into with their mutual consent. Furthermore, the mention on the 90-days clause, may be that, if the buyer does not pay the agreed-upon amount or execute within the given timeline, the agreement may be considered unfulfilled, thus giving the right to you, to forfeit the token advance, being a common legal practice in case of a default, and find for new prospective buyers after notifying the same to the present buyer on the cancellation due to non-fulfilment of the agreement entered into.

However you are at your liberty to cancel the deal if the buyer is not honoring the commitment on or before the stipulated time period but remember that you may have to return the token money to him otherwise he may sue you for either recovery of that amount or may even file a suit for specific performance of contract claiming execution of sale deed. ."

        "full_text": "Partition of agricultural land. My grandfather Ram and his brother Ghanshyam had an agricultural land in my village. They both are no more. My family and GhansShaym's family are registered as joint owners in that land. Currently both families are cultivating that land such that, orientation of the property is such that on one side there is a main road, and all three sides the land is bounded by private lands. GhanShyam's family is cultivating the entire portion which is adjacent to the main road and we are cultivating the backward portion and my grandfather had constructed a tubewell in the bottom right corner of the land which was used to irrigate the entire land as well as other neighboring lands. Ghanshyam's family members have started to sell their portion to which we objected, and hence a partition suit was filed since the khasra number is the same and we demanded the land to be divided equally such that each party gets the fair share of the main road. Patwari has also prepared kurre giving every co-owner the share on the main road. My uncle has objected to the Kurre stating that he has kabza on the entire front portion and land was already divided 50 years back and they left a easement way for us to access the main road which is lie, and no written agreement or government record exists stating that. My question is: q1. will the land be considered divided or undivided? q2 courts generally prefer historical patterns on equal distribution? q3 whose position is stronger, I want equal distribution of the land and they want to just give us an easement way? q4 How much time these cases generally take ?",
        "answers": [
            "It is undivided land 2) court would divide land equally 3) you have a strong case 4) suits for partition take over 10 years to be disposed of 5) seek stay order restraining uncle from selling the land",
            "Don't be bothered....Your partition suit must be decided in your favour. If Kurre has been prepared, the case would be decided promptly. Family arrangement is taken as an evidence of it is written. If written family arrangement is not available on record, the court will decide the case in accordance with Kurre made by patwari. (****Please rate)",
            "1. It is undivided property. 2. Court will pass an order for division of property as per provisions of law. 3. You can enforce your rights through court to get your entitled share of property by filing a suit for partition with separate possession. 4. It may take many years for the court to dispose the suit for partition.",
            "I don’t understand your query",
            "Dear Client, In your case, this agricultural land appears to be undivided legally because no written agreement exists or a government record confirms that the land has been divided between your family and Ghanshyam's family earlier. According to Indian laws related to property and partition, not having any document with such registration for partition deeds also enhances your position to demand equal and just distribution of your share in the land. Since, no written or registered agreement documents the partition that occurred 50 years ago, the court will most likely treat the land as undivided. That would make it possible to partition the land now through the legal process. Courts generally seek a just division of jointly held property, and because access to the main road is critical to the value of the land, the partition likely will occur on an equal division principle. On the other hand, patwari's kurre also suggests equal shares on the main road. Your case is stronger due to the fact that there is no proof or official document of the government that exists for their claim of initial division. A formal agreement or official record mostly happens in partition-related cases and the absence of such written evidence weakens their case. This is further supported by your argument against their selling the land, as well as Patwari's suggestion to partition in your favor. Cases involving partition might take 2-5 years or even more depending on the complexity of the case and how crowded the judicial schedule is. Therefore, you will want to create all records and proof related to the case as it can go as far as no written agreement before making a case for fair partition; there may also be an injunction that does not allow the sale or transfer of the land until the court finalizes the partition. I hope this explanation meets your needs precisely. If you still have any queries regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact us again."

Here, the developer has allotted parking slots to new members; however, the remaining slots have to be shared fairly among the original owners. Since you do not own a car currently but wish to have a parking slot for future sale purposes, you can seek out the society and request it to allot you a parking slot. The society has all the rights when first established to allot the parking slots fairly and in a clear manner, normally either through a lottery system or even an equal distribution.

            "There is a concession in stamp duty for gift deeds between close relatives in Madhya Pradesh. A gift deed is a voluntary transfer of property from one person to another without any consideration. It's usually a cost-effective choice for transfers within families. In Madhya Pradesh, gift deeds attract 5% stamp duty. However, when property is gifted form one family member to another, the stamp duty is 400 basis points lower: the doner will pay only 1% stamp duty",

A family settlement allows for peaceful division of property among family members and if executed without monetary consideration might attract minimal stamp duty unlike a gift deed. Document and register the family settlement to protect your son's rights against potential claims from outside partners or other family members. In addition, you may like to have the deed of your partnership firm amended to reflect the transfer of your share to your son, so that he is protected by law Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",

Section 4(1) of the Act reads as under:-\"4. Prohibition of transfer of granted lands.- (1) Notwithstanding anything in any law, agreement, contract or instrument, any transfer of granted land made either before or after the commencement of this Act, in contravention of the terms of the grant of such land or the law providing for such grant, or sub-section (2) shall be null and void and no right, title or interest in such land shall be conveyed or be deemed ever to have conveyed by such transfer.\" It is very clear from the above provision of Section that if any transfer of granted land is alienated, which is contrary to the Land Grant Rules, will be null and void.If the original grantee is filing an application under section 5 of the act, with regard to terms of Section 5 of the Act which enables any interested person to make an application for having the transfer annulled as void under Section 4 of the Act. the court can pass an order declaring the sale or the transaction as null and void. However the supreme court has ruled in favor of the purchaser stating that the land was alienated after 15 year of allotment to the grantee hence any application made resumption of land the same is not maintainable. .

Our plan is to vacate the tenants, demolish this shopping complex and reconstruct and let it out for large format shops. We normally sign 11 months agreement and tenants are unwilling to vacate after the agreement even if we are ready to offer compensation to move to other place. Since the rent is very nominal compared to neighboring places and they have been occupying for 15 years, they deny to vacate. with the intention to vacate legally leveraging the new tenancy act, all the recent renewals with the existing (for 11 months) and registered in tenancy portal and initiated eviction case against 4 of the tenants (post the agreement duration) under the new tenants act \"The Tamil Nadu Regulation of Rights and Responsibilities of Landlords and Tenants Act, 2017\" . We have sought eviction on the grounds for using the shop for personal (owners use). the tenants are unnecessarily dragging the case- after the initial 2/3 adjournments , our advocate is filling memo to expedite the case since as per the act the case need to be completed in 90 days . Complex owner is my father who is 76 years old and we have stated this also as reason for speedy execution in the memo filed. But desptie this, we see each case could take atleast 8 months to 1 year to complete and even if we win the case, tenants are ready to appeal in higher court just so that they can keep enjoying the property. Tenants intention is that they will keep dragging the case so that we give up on them and let them continue. I'm humbly Seeking your legal opinion - 1. for the upcoming renewals (after the completion of currently) - is there any alternate form of agreement (corporate agreement or license agreement) we can sign up with the existing tenant that will enable us to speedily vacate through police. 2. Is there any way where we get proactively intiate eviction court proceddings like 6 months before agreement date asking for judgement to vacate the property at the date of closure of agreement 2. Does leave and license agreement help the landlords to take over possession immediately after the agreement expiry and what is the procedure to enforce this at the end of agreement duration 3. In case if we have vacate all the tenants (after their respective tenant period) at once sighting reconstruction as reason - how can we proceed with that - our build is 25 years and can we get structural engineer opinion to demolish the property or can we sight reconstruction for our business purpose and file eviction. can the tenants file suit to stall this plan please let me know if there are any other suggestions to easily vacate the property by drafting the renewal agreements in favour of us",

Leave and License: It makes it easier to obtain eviction upon expiry of the agreement through legal notices and, if required, filing for repossession in court. 4. Rebuilding-Based Eviction: You can file an eviction case based on the fact that rebuilding is proposed under the Tamil Nadu Rent Act, with a structural engineer's report for the demolition purpose. Tenants may claim but the court is likely to accept landowners' petitions claiming genuine rebuilding purposes. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",

But in the year 1997 our landlord died and he was having no one in his family. So no one has came to collect rent till the year 2015. But in the year 2015, one of his legal heir has came and started asking for the rent for all the pending years, we have around 25 rooms in that chawl and he has started asking rent from all the room owners. We all were ready to pay the rent but have asked him to show the legal heirship documents if he has but he has refused to show. Now in the year 2017, he has sent summon to 4 room owners and filed a case that we are not paying rent, we all 4 room owners went in court but he was never coming for hearing . After 6 hearing, my father and otehr room owners got fed up and stopped attending the hearing, meanwhile around the pandemic time, our lawyer also passed away. Nor before a week, landlord has again sent us a summon that we are not attending any hearings and in the summon he has mentioned to pay all the rent with interest and vacant the place within 30 days for receving the summon. We all 4 room owners are always ready to pay the rent if he shows his legal ownership. He has also filed that we have constructed the 1+1 room, without his & BMC permission in the year 1999, but he was not even available a that time. Why he has sent summon to only 4 of us and not to all the room owners. Many room owners has build up 1+1, without permission than why we only 4 rooms.

            "Ideally the tenant is to approach the landlord for paying the rent The tenant is required to show his readiness and willingness to pay the rent on time If the landlord stopped coming to the building to collect rent, then the tenant ought to have approached the landlord for paying the rent The tenant must show and prove that he made all inquiries to find the whereabouts of the landlord or his heirs If the heirs could not be traced, the tenant ought to have deposited the rent in the Small Causes Court to show his bonafides and willingness to pay the rent However it appears that in your case none of the above was done Just because someone claiming to be the heir of the landlord appeared after 8 years, the tenant cannot be heard to say that since no one from the landlord's end came in the building to collect rent for the last 8 years, that's why the tenant didn't take any steps to pay the rent. The obligation to pay rent is on the tenant. The landlord has got no legal obligation to go to the building and collect rent from his tenants So I am afraid that in your case the judgment will be passed against the tenant for being in arrears of rent and for not taking any positive steps to tender the rent to the landlord to show the tenant's readiness and willingness to pay rent If there was any doubt about the person claiming to be the heir of the landlord, the tenant ought to have deposited rent in court until such person produced an heirship certificate. This was not done. So mostly likely the tenants will suffer an eviction decree As regards the unauthorized construction, that too cannot be justified by saying that why only 4 tenants are targeted and why not others who have also made such unauthorized extensions and alternations. If the tenant is in breach of the tenancy terms and Municipal law , he cannot be heard to say that he is entitled to commit such breach since others have committed it too So on the ground of making unauthorized changes to the tenanted premises as well the tenant will suffer an eviction decree I must inform you that prior to the filing of the suit the heir must have issued a statutory demand notice u/s 15. So the tenant has got 2 opportunities to pay the arrears of rent and avoid an eviction decree for the time being. One is when he tenders the rent to the landlord within the statutory period mentioned in the statutory demand notice and another is when the tenant deposits the rent in court within the set time limit after receiving court summons Also you cannot take the plea that the claim of arrears of rent is barred by limitation since there are Bombay High Court judgments which have held that the tenant has to deposit the time barred rent claims as well to avoid eviction. So your case appears to be quite weak",

            "Dear Client, I would like to inform you that,under the Pagdi system, you are being protected under the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. If the landlord's legal heir is demanding rent from you, he must prove first his legal ownership- succession certificate or legal heirship documents. You are entitled to ask for proof before paying rent. Regarding the notice, you must appear at court. The legal successor may try to make a case of non-payment to make the case for eviction; but by proving that you are willing to pay once the legal ownership is clear, this will go in your favor. The charge of construction without permission (1+1) would be a valid ground to create a case under Section 16(1) of the Act if one includes that this was done without the appropriate permissions from BMC. Since you are not alone and there are other tenants in the same situation, you can move this to court. Recommend getting a new lawyer to prepare for your case at the hearing on 23rd October. The court will then proceed to determine whether the landlord has satisfied his duties of establishing his ownership prior to ordering any eviction or back rent pay order. Thank you.

I have applied for NOC with the duly filled performa released by DOPT, to travel abroad on a private visit, where all expenditure will be borne by me. I applied for NOC almost 5 weeks before the scheduled departure. It has been 2 weeks and I have not yet been given NOC. The registrar of the university also delayed giving NOC last time when i had to visit germany and due to that i could not apply for visa that time. This time the country i am travelling to has visa-on-arrival. also, the duration for which i am travelling, there are no classes as per academic calendar as student have exams . so my absence would not hamper anything. My department Head has also sanctioned my leave I wish to know 1) should i buy tickets and proceed on leave as per informed dates without NOC 2) what actions can my university take? 3) My university is harassing me since two years now. what actions can i take ?",
        "answers": [
            "If leave sanctioning authority and the competent authority may sanction leave to a Government servant to go abroad, it is clear that no separate NOC is required. The instructions on the subject apart, it belies common sense as to why NOC to go abroad would be separately required if leave of an employee specifically asked to go abroad has since already been allowed, particularly when both the orders, be it grant of leave to go abroad or NOC to go abroad, are to be accorded by the same person. 2) if you are granted leave then no NOC is required 3) you can book your tickets 4) university may take disciplinary action if no leave has been sanctioned",
            "1. If your service regulation prescribed getting NOC as mandatory precedent then you can not travel without this to avoid future disciplinary action. 2. As per the service Rule and Regulation. 3. Write to the higher authority or change the institution.",
            "You come under the government employee category hence you would be required to obtain NOC from your authority to travel abroad. If you still proceed without NOC then your competent authority can initiate departmental action against you for defying the regulations and rules. If you are not able to get along with this working atmosphere you may decide to change the employer.",
            "Dear Client, Here is the possible response to your queries. 1) In your case, purchasing tickets and proceeding on leave without NOC is not advisable. Government employees, as you are also part of this system at universities, have Indian law making it necessary to obtain a No Objection Certificate for foreign travel as a check to transparency and accountability, as per the guidelines of the Department of Personnel and Training, DoPT. Hence, proceeding without NOC may call for disciplinary action in the form of treating the absence as unauthorized leave, issuing a show-cause notice or suspension for non-compliance. 2) Such actions may be taken by the university under the service conduct rules governing the behavior of government employees. In fact, the consistent refusal or even delay in the issuance of the NOC may well be a basis for a complaint under the rubric of harassment. You may file a formal grievance with the committee of the university, pointing out the unwarranted delay when all conditions are satisfied, including consent from your Head of Department, and there would be no implication on classes. 3) If it is a recurring issue, you would be well advised to take up the issue with the UGC and approach the CAT seeking redress for the delay and harassment inflicted upon you under service rules. You may even file a writ petition in the High Court for redress for the undue delay and non-issuance of the NOC, which hinders your rights and causes unwarranted distress. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",
            "1. As per rule even if there is no classes , then also the NOC is required to travel abroad for you being a government employee. - You can send a reminder to the office of the registrar for grant of NOC on urgent basis 2. If you proceed with your trip without the NOC, the university can initiate disciplinary action after issuing a show cause notice or Memo 3. You can approach the higher authorities such as the Vice-Chancellor or even the Education Department of the Delhi Government. - Further, you can also file a complaint before the Court against the harassment"

        "full_text": "Neighbor wants NOC to get plan sanction in Gurugram. I have a plot in Gurugram, Haryana. My neighbor ( immediately adjoining plot ) wants to construct Stilt + 4 floors building on his land and is asking from NOC from neighbor, as is required under Haryana construction laws for plan sanction, - this includes a question as to whether I have any objection to him building a basement. I have a small residential unit on my plot, with no basement, - my concern is if he makes basement he should not disturb my building foundation. Secondly, even more importantly, I will myself require consent of adjacent property owners when I need to get plan sanctioned for constructing a full stilt + 4 floor structure, even though after 3-4 years. Is there an enforceable legal mechanism under which I can get a written undertaking from the neighbor that he promises to grant me written consent, when I require it in future, when I build a full building ? Another point is that the present neighbor is in all likelihood a builder who will sell the property floor wise and 3-4 years from now, he will be out and there will be 4 different owners. In that likely scenario, will any such undertaking have any value ? Is it legally possible and enforceable to include a clause in the undertaking that any future sale agreement / sale deed that the neighbor will execute with respect to part of the property will include this undertaking, making the undertaking binding on future owners of part or whole of the property ? At least for the basement, I can ask him to promise in writing that he will leave 2 feet area undisturbed when he makes basement so my foundation is not disturbed . This query is practical- if I do ask my neighbor something in return for my consent, it should be legally feasible and enforceable, should be of practical legal value, otherwise it will spoil the atmosphere unnecessarily and embarrass me. Or should I, gracefully, just ask that his construction should not disturb my construction and give my consent ? I want to be co operative and a good neighbor but if there is a legally enforceable document I can ask for ( I don't even know if he will agree to my requirement ) I should definitely ask for it since I myself will be in the same boat ( require consent from neighbors ) a few years later.

No undertaking or an agreement based on any unforeseen future contingent will be maintainable nor it will be enforceable in law. The neighbor can refuse to give any such undertaking as you desire, hence do not take any such decision, just drop such ideas.",
            "Dear Client, To relieve your apprehensions with the construction plans of your neighbours in Gurugram you should ask him to furnish a written commitment that he will not encroach the basement nearer that 2 feet from your property in order to preserve the stability of the structure of your property. Also, you can get a guarantee for the future construction consent and also provide a clause where any future owners pledge to this agreement. This may improve the concept of the enforcement of the undertaking. In the Haryana Building Code, developers are often expected to obtain No Objection Certificates from their neighbours, hence such agreements should be reduced into writing. As much as courtesy goes in any neighbourly relation, getting these commitments may save your net as you prepare for future constructions. The best thing that could be done when preparing such documents is to seek the service of a legal attorney. Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem.",

        "full_text": "VAO is not prepared to issue patta for partial heirs. According to my grandfather's will, my six siblings and I became the property owners. Currently, there's a partition suit ongoing in court. When we asked the local VAO for individual pattas, we were informed that they couldn't provide them due to the pending case. However, upon checking the patta details last week, I noticed that the names of two legal heirs were already listed alongside my grandfather's name. When we requested to add the remaining heirs' names, our request was denied due to the legal case. What steps can we take to either remove the names already listed or add ours? We're concerned that the two named heirs are leveraging their financial and political influence. How should we proceed legally?",

Until then you cannot get any relief.",
            "Dear Client, Regarding the property pattas you should now write a legal notice to the local VAO and the two identified heirs to inform them of your position as co-owner as per your grandfather’s will and to demand them to include the name of the remaining heirs in the pattas. If your request is turned down, you should file an application in respect of the pending partition suit for an order to be made to the VAO to cause the pattas to be brought up to date. It is important to document any communication made to and from the VAO and the named heirs since this may be of value in the court. For any notifications and dealing with a lawyer in a court, it will be wise to seek the services of an attorney who has transitioned in property law. Some of the legislative statutes on the topic include The Indian Succession Act of 1925, the Hindu Succession Act of 1956 and the Partition Act of 1893.

Since you do not have any documentary evidence and proof, you would have to depend upon oral testimony and circumstances with all the witnesses as well as patterns of conduct which would support your case. You may file a civil suit on the recovery of the jewellery. In this case, your mother's brothers will be obliged to respond. It would, however, depend on the presentation of oral evidence and circumstances, with no documentary evidence and the passage of time. It may also be wise to consult with an attorney on the strength of your case prior to approaching the courts legally, as the burden of proof, in this case, lies on your side.

            "Dear Client, Here is the possible response to your queries Under the Hindu Succession Act, when a Hindu male dies intestate, then his property is divided equally among his Class I legal heirs which in your case are you, your mother and sister. You are, therefore, entitled to a one-third share in both the houses, regardless of whether your mother or sister are staying in one of them. In case you let go of the property to your mother, you will surrender your claim; therefore, it would not be easy raising your stake after some time. Technically, the law would have given her full ownership of the property. The property would otherwise be divided equally among the three of you. After having received her one third, your mother is free to gift or transfer her share to your sister, but this does not affect your right to your one third. Correspondingly, regarding your father's Provident Fund (PF), you are at par with a share in that amount as a Class I heir. If the PF has already been claimed by your mother and sister, you can demand to know the details of the amounts and take legal recourse to stake your claims if necessary. If they are trying to sell their holdings and are asking you to transfer your share to your mother, you should not do that without ensuring first that you are adequately compensated for your share or otherwise protected. A consultation with a lawyer would make sure your interests were looked after in all eventualities of transfer or sale agreements. Thank you.Hope this answers your query."

        "answers": [
            "Dear Client, I would like to inform you that, In your situation, a request to declare the plaintiff as a tenant without a rental agreement or occupation cannot be considered. In order for a lease agreement to be legitimate, it must include mutual agreement, complete rent payment, and possession, all of which are absent in this particular situation. If a rental contract was not signed and the plaintiff did not meet their responsibilities, they have no grounds to assert tenancy. Part performance by the transferee is necessary for Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act (doctrine of part performance) to be applicable. The plaintiff is not eligible for protection under this section since he did not fulfill his obligations in the contract. A true owner is typically not allowed to be subjected to an injunction. You can challenge the plaintiff's effort to prevent you from managing your own property with an ex-parte order. You can find support from the ruling of the Supreme Court in Karnataka Board of Wakf v. Government of India (2004) 10 SCC 779, which affirmed that a tenant or claimant without legal possession or agreement cannot seek injunction against the rightful owner. An unmarked complaint is also not considered legitimate according to Order VI Rule 14 of the CPC, 1908, which requires pleadings to be signed by the party or their authorized agent. Additionally, it should also be raised during arguments as it questions the validity. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",

Since your suit is on permanent injunction restraining interference, whereas the counter claim by defendants involves an averment that the property is an ancestral one, if they give rise to different questions of law each may be allowed to proceed with the court dealing with each case on their respective merits. With regard to the contention of the defendants that the property is an ancestral one, a registered sale deed as in the case of acquisition made by your grandfather in the year 1944 would certainly break the chain. This would mean your mother bought the property as self-acquired, not ancestral. A father can sell property to his daughter by way of executing a sale deed, if it is his self-acquired property, and the rules are stipulated under Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. It has been held in a series of judgments by the courts that once the property is acquired by purchase, it cannot be termed as ancestral property (See S. Sai Reddy v. S. Narayana Reddy, AIR 1991 SC 2086). You could represent yourself under Order III Rule 1 of the CPC, whereby parties are allowed to represent themselves. To adequately represent, ensure you have all documentary evidence, be it a sale deed, and prepare to argue on facts and legal principles, more so on the point of whether the property is ancestral or self-acquired.

            "Dear Client, I understand your concern regarding the blocking of INR 15,000 from your bank account due to a cyber complaint. Based on the information provided, I will provide an expert legal response to address your query. Under Indian law, banks are required to comply with the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines on cybersecurity. If a bank receives a cyber complaint or suspects any unauthorized or fraudulent activity related to a customer's account, it has the authority to temporarily block or freeze the account as a precautionary measure. The blocking of funds in your account could be due to the following reasons: 1. Suspected Unauthorized Transaction: If the bank suspects that your account has been compromised or used for unauthorized transactions, it may block the funds as a security measure to prevent further misuse. 2. Cybercrime Investigation: If a cybercrime complaint has been filed against you or your account, the bank may have received a request from law enforcement agencies to block the funds temporarily for investigation purposes. 3. Compliance with Regulatory Requirements: Banks are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, including those related to anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT). If any suspicious activity is detected, the bank may block the funds as a precautionary measure. Regarding the lack of communication from the cybercrime authorities or the police station, it is possible that the investigation is still ongoing, and they may contact you at a later stage if required. Here are some steps you can take: 1. Obtain a Written Explanation: Request a written explanation from the bank regarding the specific reasons for blocking your funds and the nature of the cyber complaint. This will help you understand the situation better and take appropriate action. 2. Provide Necessary Information: If the bank requests any additional information or documentation from you, promptly provide the same to facilitate the resolution of the issue. 3. Seek Legal Assistance: If the issue persists or if you believe that the bank's actions are unjustified, you may consider seeking legal assistance from a competent lawyer specializing in banking and cybercrime laws. 4. File a Complaint: If the bank fails to provide a satisfactory explanation or resolution, you can file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman or the Cyber Crime Cell of your local police station, depending on the nature of the issue. It is important to note that banks are required to follow due process and provide reasonable justification for blocking funds. If it is indeed a mistake on their part, they should rectify the situation promptly. I hope this expert legal response helps you understand the situation better and guides you on the appropriate course of action. If you require any further assistance or have additional queries, please feel free to reach out. Regards, Adv Arunkumar Khedia Bombay Highcourt",
            "Police would conduct investigations and if no fraud has been committed by you then your bank account will be unfrozen",
            "From your statement it seems the complaint has been lodged against your account number where money might have been credited from unknown accounts without their knowledge. I suggest you to check with your local ps and bank manager with this. Regards"

            "Dear Client, In the case you have described, the wife's rejection to consummate her marriage and her statement that she was married against her will by her parents can be grounds for an annulment. According to Section 12(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, a marriage is annulled when it has not been consummated with the intention or willful refusal of the other spouse. Moreover, if she had a marriage sullenly induced against her will, that too might be a ground for annulment under Section 12(1)(c) because of a lack of free consent. To get this marriage annulled, your brother has to file a petition in the family court and present proof that it hasn't been consummated with her and has no intention of fulfilling marital duties. Whatever be the case, her parents' silence is immaterial to the case, since the case involves only the couple. The court will study circumstances and determine if the marriage can be declared voidable. Since this marriage isn't consummated, there's more chances of a successful annulment petition. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",

The new owner without applying for any sanction directly illegally constructed an additional floor of 3800 sq ft, increasing the height above 23 M,covered the inner courtyard into transport Godown approx 2500 sq ft. Installed a lift upto the G+5 & above without any license from Chief Electrical Inspector. There was a FIR lodged in the year 2017 by Assistant Engineer,Civil,Borough V KMC saying that the unauthorised constructions were done on a portion of 5th floor stating that it's a old building,which may collapse and risk human lives & property u/s 401a but never issued any Stop Work Notice & Another FIR against new owner for digging a lift well without KMC Sanctions on the ground floor.In 2018 a cosmetic demolition was also done by KMC in presence of Police officials for their records. New owner sold the entire 5th floor in 2018 giving full details of the floor by sale of agreement recieving full payment of 1.8 crores but was not mutated or registered. The Godown was also sold in the same year and was registered,mutated. The 5th floor was registered in 2022 40 months after making the full payment in 2018.

The Rights of the other parties based on 20 year old registered agreement of sale cannot automatically vest him with ownership rights. Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act,1882 grants ownership only upon a registered sale deed, but an agreement to sell merely indicates an intention to transfer property. If the other party has not filed a suit to enforce his claim over a period of two decades, then this might further fall within the limitation under the Limitation Act, 1963, because the suits for specific performance shall be filed within three years from the date of fixed performance. The possession taken by them is illegal because the deed of transfer is invalid. You can sue for ejectment against the occupier. In any event, as litigation is already pending, you should engage an attorney to intervene in the litigation to plead your interest under the registered sale deed.

        "full_text": "Misc Cri Application Order pending from long. My wife has filed a Miscellaneous Criminal Application in the court of Nanded Maharashtra against 7 people for a forged signature of her late father on a property bond. Also along filed the signature analysis report from a private handwriting expert whose report confirms the signature is forged. Right before this petition was filed an FIR was registered on 2 out of those 7 for forcefully trying to acquire the property & causing minor injuries to my wife while doing so & now the chargesheet is also filed in court. In the Misc Cri Appl case, the judge did ask for police report for verification which did mention such incident & such acts done. The Misc Cri Appl was filed in May 2023 & Police report was seeked in Oct 2023. It’s since been reserved for order & around 14-15 dates have passed. Atleast a dozen times my wife/counsellor has appeared praying for the order. What remedy or submission can my wife seek in this Cri Appl case?",
        "answers": [
            "Complain to HC against no order being passed by judge in Nanded inspire of 15 dates having passed for orders",
            "- If the police official has already filed its report before the said Court , then the Court is under obligation to pass order after hearing the argument on that application. - If the Court is delaying the matter , then you can approach the High Court for directing to finalize the case within a fixed time.",
            "Your advocate can put pressure on the court for disposal by filing a memo to this effect. If that also do not fetch you fruitful result, you may file a petition before high court seeking direction for an expeditious disposal.",
            "Dear Client, In this condition,i would like to suggest you that, In the case of Miscellaneous Criminal Application, your wife can make a written submission under Section 528 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita,2023(BNSS) for expeditious disposal of the case. She would emphasize the point that though in the police report it has been corroborated that the incident did take place, and even in the expert's report, it was also established that it is a forged signature, and yet the case has been reserved for an order for a pretty long time and no justification for it, and therefore affects the administration of justice. By exercising the inherent powers of the court, she can ask the judge to pass such an order at an earliest date possible. The other ground is excessive delay that bypasses the principles of a fair trial and speedy justice, which are violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. If the delay continues for a long period, she may also seek redress from the High Court under a writ petition to expedite her proceedings. Thank you.Hope this answers your query.",

        "full_text": "Academic questions on mutation of agriculture land in Gujarati for Hindus. I have some academic questions. Out of 35 types of revenue mutations there are following mutations Mutation A. Distribution during life (hayati ma vahechni) or hayati ma hak dakhal Mutation B. Distribution (vechani) (after death) or varsai Now I am making some statements, can you say which statements are correct or wrong. 1. Mutations A and B are one and same thing. And beneficiary will have a \"ancestral\" title of the agriculture land. The mutual consents among all legal heirs are required for distribution and and exclusion of any legal heir is not legit entering rights of legal hairs. 2. Point 1 is true regardless the property being ancestral or self-acquired. 3. Any agriculture land with \"ancestral\" title must have come from the consent of the all the legal hairs holding the rights on land. 4. While Owner of the self-acquired property can dispose the property by means of will/gift-deed/sale-deed without anyone's consent to any legal heir. It's not possible to be partial with any legal heir while following mutations A and B.",
        "answers": [
            "They are not same .during lifetime owner of land can execute gift deed and property can be mutated in name of beneficiary 2) in B case property gets mutated on demise of testator as per his will 3) self acquired property can be disposed of by gift deed or sale or by will without consent of legal heirs 4) for ancestral property disposal consent of legal heirs is required",
            "Mutation of self acquired property during the lifetime of the owner in favor of the beneficiary can be done if the donor transfers the property by a registered gift deed or a settlement deed in favor of the donee, however the legal heirs inheriting the property upon intestate death of the deceased owner can get the property mutated jointly or on individual names when the property is partitioned among the legal heirs. The ancestral properties also can be mutated either on the joint names or on the individual names as per procedures stated above. This applies to agricultural property and also to other properties too.",
            "Dear Client, It is now clear that the two different mutations referred to as A (distribution throughout life) and B (distribution upon death) are in fact one and the same thing but different in name. Some beneficiaries may receive ancestral title which is not fair, it can cause conflicts because legal heirs are excluded while all legal heirs are expected to agree on the division. The legal heir of the property, one who has self-acquired property, has no obligation to consult other legal heirs in making decisions on utilization of the property. Not even in a simple event like the inheritance of property can those who are directly affected sit tight without giving their approval in order to safeguard those rights which if they don’t, would be violated. In India property rights or property laws are governed by several laws and part of them: ‘Hindu Succession Law’ and ‘Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 1956’ explains the concept related to the ‘inheritance of Ancestral as well as Self acquired property’. However, the issue raises a number of legal issues, and it would be more reasonable to address the experienced lawyer with an expertise in property law. Hope you find this answer helpful in resolving your problem."

        "full_text": "Acquiring Guardianship of intellectually challenged sister and share in flat. I purchased a flat in 2002, valued at 11.35 lakhs, with an additional stamp duty and registration fee of 95,000, bringing my total expenditure to around 13.5 lakhs after making it livable with grills and modifications. My father contributed 4 lakhs towards the flat's purchase. I have two younger sisters, one of whom is mentally challenged, and I have been caring for her since 1996, after my father retired from his job. Both of my parents passed away in 2022, and my father did not leave a will. The flat is registered in both my name and my father's name. My older sister has no interest in claiming anything from the estate and is willing to relinquish her claim to the flat. I have also relinquished my claim on a shop that my father purchased and gave to her. My youngest sister is invalid, illiterate, and has an IQ under 35. Since 2022, she has experienced two severe episodes of breakthrough seizures, which have significantly worsened her condition, affecting her speech and memory. The issue I face is related to my job with a government institution, which requires me to file income tax returns for my mentally challenged sister to continue receiving her medical benefits. However, to file these returns, I need a bank account in her name, but she has no income, and I provide for all her needs, including food, clothing, and medical care. Unfortunately, no bank is willing to open an account for her without formal guardianship. The guardianship case in my district has a pending timeline of 2 to 3 years. I would like to know if, for the purpose of securing guardianship, I need to demonstrate that my sister has a share in the flat, and how I would go about dividing the share, given that my father paid one-third of the flat's cost and is listed as a co-owner. My sister is currently 51, and I am 54; I have been responsible for her care for nearly 28 years. Any guidance on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.",

There is a Right of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 under which tribunals are set up to deal with such cases However to my knowledge so far no tribunal is constituted under the above act So a writ petition can be filed in the High Court invoking its parens patriae jurisdiction seeking your appointment as a guardian of your younger sister with the consent of your other sister I assume that you 3 are the only heirs of your late father The guardian would be required to be appointed for opening a bank account in the name of the younger sister and for transferring her share in the flat which is jointly owned by you and your late father Please note that even if your father had contributed only 1/3rd of the purchase price , in absence of any mention in the sale deed about the % holding of the co purchasers , it would be deemed that both hold equal undivided share in the flat , unless you can prove in a declaratory suit that your shareholding in the flat is more than that of your father So taking the late father's share in the flat to be 50%, that share will equally devolve on his 3 children and upon your elder sister giving up her claim in the flat , the said 50% will go to you and your younger sister equally. Thus in effect you would become 75% co owner and your younger sister 25%",
            "Dear Client, I would like to let you know that, The flat is situated in a property co-owned between you and your deceased father, and falls under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. Since your father died intestate, his share in the said property would be distributed equally among his legal heirs, that is you and two sisters. Under the Act of Mental Health Care, 2017, one may file for guardianship for a mentally challenged sister who shall explain that condition and the role played by a person as a caregiver. The same may be filed under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. Once you gain her guardianship, you would have all rights to administer her share in the flat, if so required, and open a bank account in her name for filing her income tax returns and ensuring continued medical benefits. Distribution of assets would indeed be relevant during the process of obtaining guardianship in order to show that you have been responsible in managing her share, but your primary aim is to establish her inability and your status as guardian. It will be wise to consult a legal professional with experience in family or guardianship law to help you through this process. Thank you.Hope this answers your query."

        "question_url": "https://www.kaanoon.com/474443/parking-allotment",
        "full_text": "Parking Allotment. In my society, I am being threatened that facilities to my apartment will be stopped if I do not pay a monthly maintenance fee of ₹700. However, my refusal to pay is based on the following: My property registry document explicitly mentions a parking space associated with my 2BHK flat, for which I paid extra stamp duty. While the registry does not specify the exact area of the parking space, it does confirm 'standard parking.' The builder has not issued a formal parking allotment letter, and the society argues that without such a letter, my claim to the parking space is invalid. Despite this, they are currently renting out my parking space for ₹1000 per month since my tenant does not use it, yet they still demand I pay maintenance fees. My arguments are: (1) I have already paid for the parking space, which is mentioned in my registry; (2) the society is generating income from renting out the parking space without my consent; (3) I have requested they vacate my parking space, after which I am willing to pay the maintenance fee, but they refuse, claiming my parking allotment is illegal; and (4) none of the other 40 flats have parking allotments mentioned in their registry, which the society uses to justify their stance. Is it legally valid for the society to disregard the parking allotment in my registry and demand maintenance while they profit from my parking space? What legal options do I have to protect my rights in this situation?\"",

            "1. If your registered sale deed is clear with recitals confirming allotment of parking space to you, then the association cannot refuse to allot the parking space to you.Under the \"Apartment Act\" in most States, parking spaces are considered a part of a society's common areas, making it unlawful for builders to sell them as separate units. It will also be illegal if a builder attempts to register parking spaces as independent units. 2. You can give a complaint against the society, if it is a registered body, with the deputy registrar of cooperative societies for relief and remedy. If you do not find any solution from the registrar then you can approach court of law seeking remedy to this. 3. As per the National Building Code, one car parking space must not be less than 13.75 sq meters. For a 2-wheeler, it must not be less than 1.25 sq meters. 4. If the builder mentioned in the Sale deed regarding the sale of parking , then on this ground you can claim a right over the same from the society as well without having to produce the allotment letter.",
            "Dear Client, This is the possible response to your queries Under Indian law, especially the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act, 1963, once parking space is mentioned in your property registry and you have paid stamp duty, your right to the parking space is established. The absence of a formal allotment letter from the builder does not nullify your right, especially if the sale deed mentions \"standard parking.\" The claim of the society that your allotment is invalid is not legally sound. The society cannot arbitrarily withhold services or rent out your parking space without your consent, as this would amount to illegal enrichment. The Supreme Court, in multiple rulings, has upheld that parking spaces sold along with flats become the property of the flat owner. You can approach the Registrar of Societies or even file a consumer court complaint against unfair trade practice and seek relief on the parking issue with compensation for unauthorised occupation of your space. The society cannot, lawfully speak of stopping services to your apartment for non-payment of maintenance while making handsome profits out of your parking space.

            "Dear Sir, Can’t deprive residents of water, power: Experts Bengaluru: Can an apartment association take coercive measures. Such as disconnecting water or power supply to a flat whose owner hasn’t paid maintenance charges? Though every association wants absolute power to crack down against errant flat owners, the reality is that legally, it is not allowed. According to the legal experts STOI spoke to, no resident welfare association (RWA), housing society or apartment association has the authority to deprive residents of water, electricity, housekeeping and other essential services. “Any non-payment or irregular payment of a resident’s share in the expenses would not confer any right on the apartment association to disconnect water supply,” said MP Srikanth, a practicing high court advocate. As per the procedure, the names of defaulters have to be published on the association notice board, and they have to be given a short period to comply. If they fail to respond, a legal notice demanding payment of arrears should be sent. If the defaulters fail to pay even after receipt of the notice a suit for recovery has to be filed in a civil court. SECTION 7 OF THE KARNATAKA APARTMENT OWNERSHIP ACT, 1972"

            "Dear Client, Regarding the issue of your mother-in-law wishing to execute a gift deed for the BDA-allotted site, it is important to consider the specific legal constraints associated with the property. As per BDA allotment rules, the sale or transfer of the allotted property is restricted based on a regulation that does not allow the separation of the property for 10 years from the date of allotment. As the allotment only occurred seven years ago then any dealing regarding the site, through sale or through gift deeds will definitely be considered against these regulations. While a gift deed is not a sale, it is a conveyance of property and as such BDA considers all such conveyances to be restricted until the end of the 10 year term. In case your mother-in-law goes on to execute the gift deed before this period is over then the BDA has the potential client’s right to sue and this can be in a bid to counter the allotment. It would of course be safer from a legal perspective to simply wait ten years, or alternatively apply to the BDA to find out whether an such a transfer, under any circumstances, is possible at all. It is for this reason I advised to conform to these regulations and seek legal advice from a specialized lawyer in order to ensure that your mother-in-law is fully compliant with the regulations outlined by BDA. I hope this insight provides the direction you need. If you have any further queries regarding the matter, do not hesitate to reach us again.",

            "Since the lock-in period of ten years has been specified by the BDA and only seven years has been completed post allotment, the execution of Gift Deed by your mother-in-law to her daughter at this stage does not confer legal ownership to the daughter. Instead of opting for Gift Deed now, let your mother-in-law execute a WILL in favour of her daughter and after the ten year lock-in period is over, your mother-in-law can execute a registered Gift Deed in favour of her daughter."

            "Married daughter has no share in agricultural land in UP 2) nominee is trustee for legal heirs 3) your sister is not absolute owner of the other properties 4) file suit for partition to claim share on other properties",
            "In Uttar Pradesh: married daughters in Uttar Pradesh do not have the same inheritance rights as unmarried daughters when it comes to their father's agricultural land: Uttar Pradesh law stated that unmarried daughters could inherit their father's property, but married daughters could not. This effectively forced daughters to choose between marriage and inheritance. Earlier even unmarried daughters were not having equal rights in the agricultural land at par with sons. The state adopted the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006, which gave unmarried daughters the same inheritance rights as sons, but weaker rights to married daughters. Now that the Uttar Pradesh law provides that an unmarried daughter stands to inherit a share of her father’s property and loses that standing when she marries, it effectively becomes a question of choosing either marriage or land ownership. Also, this difference in treatment may encourage her brothers to desire that their sister marry at the earliest possible opportunity, so that she will not compete with them for inheritance.",
            "Dear Client, As per your concerns regarding the agricultural land in Uttar Pradesh and your married sister’s actions, let me clarify your legal standing under Indian laws. Firstly, according to the Hindu Succession Act of 1956 with amendment in year 2005, the rights of the married as well as unmarried daughter regarding their father’s property including the agricultural one are identical. Due to UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, in Uttar Pradesh married daughters were not allowed to take agriculture land but Supreme Court of India in recent judgments has clarified that daughters also are co-heirs and thus entitled to equal share in ancestral property. Thus your married sister does have your right to the agricultural land. As for your mother’s share, since she died intestate, this share of the property will now go to legal heirs which are you and your sister. However, as far as the existing legislation which governs the property rights in the country concerns, your sister has the legal right to also stake a claim over the share of your mother’s portion. The same can be said for the other assets like the flat and fixed deposits, for nomination in your sisters favor legally entitles her unless of course a civil lawsuit is filed against the nomination. In my opinion, you should object to mutation proceedings and if needed file a partition suit in the civil court to protect your share in the said property. In light of these issues, it is essential to contact a competent lawyer immediately to protect your inheritance from your sister and manage with any unjustified misuse. Please seek further legal advice from a property lawyer as regards to the actions that should be taken especially in compiling evidence, filing for claims among other matters. I hope this perspective adds value to your considerations. If you have any further queries regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact us again.",
            "Dear Madam, Nomination does not create any rights on the amounts received by nominee after the death of the account holder. Thus, you are also entitled for 50% of such amount. You have to check local law especially UP zamindari Act about your share in the agriculture land. As per general law you are entitled for equal share along with your married sister.",
            "As far as UP state is concerned the supreme court judgement has not over rules the state act. The state act clearly states that the married daughters are not entitled for a share in the agricultural property."

Taking advantage of it, My father in law's both brothers and his sister created a fabricated MOU saying they have share in the agency and its immovable properties. initially they invoked Arbitration where a retd judge being arbitrator colluded with them. however, the arbitration cases filed them jointly were dismissed with costs in the court of law. But, as a last resort my father in law's sister alone filed a Original Suit asking for 50% share in the agency and its properties. all they have the proof is MOU. Now, it has reached TRIAL and Plaintiff evidence and marking of the documents where she is aged 75 years and pleaded court for appointment of advocate commissioner. I would request your good selves to provide with some advise on opposing this MOU on some grounds.

They have auctioned the plots of 13500 square foot to each member.they give procession of the plot with proper demarcation and no, mentioning the block with proper map. Yet they do not register the documents or pay stamp duty. From the last 50 years they only give share certificate to the members. Every outgoing member sells the plot on a 500 rupees stamp paper and noterised the document. Society transfers the certificate to the new owner. The 7/12 of the total land is in society name. Neither they put the name of each member in 7/12 nor they look into whether the stamp duty is paid to the government. My question, is it legal to sell and purchase the plot without paying the stamp duty from the last 50 years and still transfer the share certificate, of a particular plot with demarcation. Every member has own electricity connection in their names. The managing committee says the actual ownership lies with society as 7/12 is in the name of the society. Is it ok, what can be done to get the document registered and how can we pay the stamp duty to the government.",

The funds are from earnings, interest income / business income, of earlier and current years, on which income tax has been regularly paid by the HUF.

It will be taxable in hands of HUF. 2) HUF might have business income, capital gain, income from house property or other sources. It has an option to either reinvest such income or distribute amongst its members. Members must not receive beyond their stake in the HUF as a whole.At the time of such distribution person should be the member of the HUF which will save him from taxes. Such apportionment of income will not be then taxable in hands of the recipient. 3) The share of each coparcener in an HUF is usually equal, but this can be changed with the consent of all coparceners.",
            "Gifts permitted by HUF to its members satisfying to the conditions of Section 10(2) are exempt from Income Tax in the hands of recipients. The remuneration paid by the HUF to the karta or any member is deductible if it meets certain criteria, like genuineness, reasonability, and is paid under a valid agreement. If the karta does not have a high income, the HUF can pay him a salary for his services. A member of the HUF is treated as relative of the HUF hence there is no tax implication at the time of the receipt of the money for HUF. It can be treated as a gift if the money is not intended to be repaid. As per Section 56(2), any gift received from specified relatives is tax-free in the hands of the recipient. A member of the HUF is treated as a relative of the HUF; hence, there is no tax implication when receiving money from the HUF.

But check the deed executed or agreement prepared on stamp paper while setting up the HUF to know the exact terms and conditions for handling bank account/s by the karta or member.",
            "Dear Client, I want to let you know that, in accordance with Section 10(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, any money received by a member of a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) is completely free from income tax, even if the HUF has already been assessed tax on the income. Thus, no further taxes are due on the amount that the Karta withdraws from the HUF. Therefore, there is no legal requirement for the requisite distribution of calculated income in a ratio between the coparceners when the HUF is still in existence and has not experienced total division under Section 171 of Income Tax Act,1961. Instead, the Act's specific provisions address this scenario. With the support of all co-workers, an equitable distribution of the funds could then be decided upon.Still, these tendencies are typically pertinent to the partition, as the Supreme Court pointed out in N. S. Getti Chettiar Vs. CIT 82 ITR 599. In fact, as the Karta, you have the power to withdraw funds from the HUF without needing to divide them equally—as long as you do so in a transparent manner and, if required, obtain consent from the other coparceners to ensure the family's well-being. Income tax laws do not forbid withdrawals connected to HUFs during their existence. Thank you.Hope this answers your query."

        "full_text": "Property registration after RERA expired. I booked a flat with a builder on 21st July 2024. I gave a cheque of 5 lakhs as initial token amount. On 30th July 2024 the RERA expired for the project. I make another payments of total 70 lakhs + 13 lakhs for stamp duty via multiple cheque until 20th August 2024 to the builder. In August end we were going to go for registration. On the day of registration the builder tells me that there is a minor technical issue. Our RERA has expired hence the registrar office is saying we cannot do any registration. The builder is not planning to apply for RERA extension as he is going to apply for OC soon and does not want to waste money with RERA extension. Almost all the flats in the building are already registered and only few (maybe 3) are cases similar to mine. The builder told me that since I made the payment of 5 lakhs on 21st July 2024 before RERA expired and has already given me an allotment letter of date 21st July 2024, he is going to request the registrar office that we should be allowed to register as our deal was done before RERA expired. My question is : 1. Is the builder correct when he says that we can apply for registration because we had made initial deal before RERA expiry based on initial 5 lakhs cheque? 2. I heard that by law you are allowed to go for registration within 4 months of agreement. So does it mean that when I make a deal on 21st July 2024, I should be allowed to go for registration 4 months from that day even if RERA has expired by then? 3. When I asked the question number 2 to builder he mentioned that in order for us to be eligible for 4 months window we should have payed stamp duty before RERA expiry only then its allowed for us. Is this true? 4. Do you need to pay stamp duty before RERA expiry? Can stamp duty be paid after RERA expiry? Are those two any how related? 5. Builder says if he simply applies for OC then just based on the OC application he can have our flat registration done? Is it true? Does just an OC application is sufficient or does the OC have to be approved and only then registration can be done on RERA expired project? 5. What are my option in this case? Thanks in advance.",
        "answers": [
            "1) builder can request registrar office to register sale deed as payment made prior to registration .it is doubtful that registration would be permitted 2) under section 6 of RERA act promoter can apply for project extension for a maximum period of 1 year. Provided that the Authority may in reasonable circumstances, without default on the part of the promoter, based on the facts of each case, and for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend the registration granted to a project for such time as it considers necessary for period not exceeding 1 year. 3)The department of revenue and forest has issued a Government Regulation dated 20th September 2019, in which it has stated that the registration of agreement for Sale / Sale Deed of any apartments will be done only if the project is registered or excluded from Registration under real estate act . 4) the sale deed is executed after the RERA registration has expired, it may not be legally valid. The buyer might not have recourse under RERA, which protects buyers against builders and developers. 5) insist that builder has applied for and been granted extension of time by RERA before you register sale deed",
            "1) you cannot apply for registration as the circular cited herein above prohibits registration if RERA registration has expired 2) it cannot be done as RETA registration has expired 3) registration can be done within 4 months of execution of sale deed if registration under RERA is in force 4) stamp duty cannot be paid after RERA expiry 5) merely on basis of OC application registration cannot be done 6) already informed that you insist that builder seeks extension from RERA",
            "1. real estate regulatory authorities (RERA) do not allow extensions for project registration beyond one year. There are further restrictions of not transferring the project to the allottees/association till the promoter obtains the completion/occupancy certificate. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) of 2016 allows for a project's registration to be extended in certain circumstances, but not beyond one year. 2. Your question is based on some rumors spread by people who do not know the law properly, there is no such thing. Property registration must be completed within four months of executing the sale deed and not from the date of executing the sale agreement. 3. Your builder may give some lame excuses which are not maintainable in law 4.Without paying the stamp duty the property cannot be registered 5. The OC is not a document which is required mandatorily for property registration as its not a document of title evidencing the ownership of the seller instead it is required only if the stamp duty benefit is being claimed on account of old construction. Sometimes, the purchaser takes the benefit/depreciation of the stamp duty in the event of sale of flat of an old building, in such case the Sub-registrar in order to check the veracity of the construction insist on the copy of occupancy certificate or municipal assessment bills.",
            "The opinions are given taking care of the prevailing law in respect of the problems you are facing. The builder may be insisted to apply for extension of RERA if that is the only impediment for doing the registration of the property. As a matter of fact the OC is not a mandatory document for registering the flat, but since the property came under the RERA registration and s the registration stands expired, the builder is somehow trying to push the property to obtain OC without completing the construction on the basis of the occupation of the property by the owners, the renewal fee for RERA extension may be additional expenses for the builder hence he is trying to bear it, if the builder is not cooperating then you can issue a legal notice to him to either get the property registered as per law or to refund the booking amount with interest and after that you can drag him to the consumer forum for relief and remedy",
            "it is highly unfortunate what has happened to you i think the builder has been fooling you if his rera registration had expired then under the law he could NOT accept any further payments from you unless and until he got his rera registration renewed so the builder could not have collected any payments from you after 30.7.24 secondly the builder telling you that the sub-registrar is not registering the agreement for sale because there is no rera registration or that the registration has expired, is complete rubbish. The sub-registrar has under the registration act no such jurisdiction to refuse registration of the agreement due to rera registration having been expired. I would really like to know and I am quite curious under which provision of law did the sub-registrar refuse the registration as there was no rera registration thirdly the builder is obligated under RERA to compulsorily register an agreement for sale upon receiving 10% of the total sale consideration in your case i believe the builder has illegally accepted more than 10% from you without valid rera registration, and did not bother to enter into and register an agreement for sale with you. Because now he is trapped he has come up with the bogey that the sub-registrar is refusing to register the agreement also if the agreement for sale is already signed by you then it has to be stamped and registered max within 4 months from the date of signing. The registration of the signed document can be done beyond 4 months also, but subject to max another 4 months, with payment of penalty. I do not know whether or not you have already signed the agreement for sale. your builder telling you that in order to register the agreement within 4 months you should have paid the stamp duty before rera expiry is again complete nonsense. As per the stamp act stamp duty has to be paid before signing or on the date of signing or on the day immediately after the day of signing. I dont know where this payment of duty before rera registration expiry, comes from. It seems the builder has been making his own rules and conning you i do not believe that just on applying for OC your agreement for sale can be registered. In my view your agreement for sale if it is duly signed and stamped, can be registered right away. It has got nothing to do with expiry of rera registration since the sub-registrar has got no power to require renewal of rera registration for registering the agreement for sale. I think if your agreement for sale is registered, then the builder will be exposed that he accepted payments from the flat buyer even after expiry of the rera registration and also he did not bother to register an agreement for sale after having accepted 10% of the total sale price. Both of these are offences under Rera. To cover his faults and guilt, he is cooking up any story before you. Highly unfortunate. Please have a legal notice issued to the builder and then consider filing a RERA complaint [I believe, on a prima facie view, that even if the rera registration has expired, a rera complaint can still be filed, because the project was rera registered. Its just the builder did not bother to renew his registration to save some charges]"

        "full_text": "Redevelopment of society based on floor plan or physical existence. Dear Sir/Madam, I lived in an apartment within a complex of four buildings, which together form a society.(location Thane Maharashtra state) I purchased the apartment in 2021; it was built in 2000, making it 24 years old, and I am the fourth owner. Last year, one of the building floors collapsed, leading to advice for all society members to vacate the premises. Consequently, all 60 members have moved out. As part of the redevelopment process, we received offers from three different builders, and the members decided to proceed with one of them. My 1 BHK flat includes a terrace of approximately 45 square feet. However, according to the new builder, the approved floor plan does not include a balcony or terrace, suggesting that the previous builder constructed the terrace illegally. Additionally, the new builder indicated that while the floor plan shows an open terrace, there is no actual terrace accessible to residents on the first floor. Furthermore, the index shows my apartment as 530 square feet, but the builder claims it is only 383 square feet. My questions :- 1. Will I receive the terrace that is physically present and for which I paid stamp duty and registration fees, considering that my flat is located at the back? Currently, there is no open terrace or balcony on the first floor, but the builder has indicated that they will adhere to the previous floor plan. 2. During redevelopment, is the physical existence of features or the floor plan used to determine entitlements? 3. I requested an architect to measure the apartment's square footage, but the society chairman and secretary has informed me that this is not necessary. Is it mandatory to appoint an architect for accurate measurement during redevelopment? 4. There is a lack of transparency as the Chairman and Secretary do not respond adequately, even to messages on WhatsApp. they are just informing a day prior on whatsapp (3 instant observed they collected documents and sign) Is it mandatory for the society to maintain a website and update all members regularly? how they will update members 5. I sent a legal notice via WhatsApp, detailing the issues mentioned, through a local lawyer, but received no response. The society claims they have hired their advocate and society is covering those costs, stating it is not their loss. what should i do in this case.",
        "answers": [
            "On redevelopment you are not entitled to terrace 2) terrace forms part of common area for benefit of all members 3) builder will check the previously sanctioned plans of your building 4) society has to appoint project management consultant for redevlopment 5) not mandatory for society to maintain a website 6) if society is not responding to legal notice complain to registrar",
            "1. Assuming your flat is registered as an apartment and the apartment owners association is a registered body. If so, all occupants are owners. Thus, all of you own part of the land in the proportion of FSI consumed/used. Unless all of you agree and sign the agreement, redevelopment can not happen. 2. As per earlier DCR, terraces were allowed free of FSI. In unified DCR that are implemented in entire Maharashtra except Mumbai, they have proposed ancillary FSI and terrace too is counted. Now, it will not be beneficial to give terraces and yiu will notice that terraces are not planned in new upcoming buildings.it may not work economically viable to give built up area same as terrace area in the proposed new building. All of you have to sit together and work out a compromise formula by coming couple of steps closer to each other. 3. The redevelopment committee of the association will take care of it. 4. It is not mandatory for the society create a website for such activities, besides the communication sent through whatsapp is also a voluntary service and cannot be claimed as a right, it is you who have to regularly follow up with the society to know the updates. 5. If you are interested to escalate the matter through legal sources then you should have sent the legal notice by registered post and not through social media or whats app media. The legal notice sent by registered post will certainly invoke response failing which yo can sue the association for deficiency in service",

            "As the members have already vacated the building and are without homes, it is but obvious that the builder will try to take advantage of that situation Ordinarily even if there are violations to the sanctioned building plans, the builder usually agrees to accommodate since the society has an upper hand. If majority members have violated the building plans then in order to get majority consent for redevelopment, the builder even goes to the extent of offering extra area over and above the eligibility of the members, from his free sale component. However that happens only when the members have not yet vacated their premises In your case the society and its members do not have that upper hand in the negotiations with the builder Though the builder is legally right that he is liable to give area in the new building considering the sanctioned building plans of old building , but this is always a matter of contract and agreement between the society and the builder Just by paying property tax and maintenance for the premises (which have been unauthorizedly expanded and extended) the extra areas do not get legitimized. Even slum dwellers pay property tax...so would it mean that their hutments are legal structures ? So in your case I would suggest to negotiate hard with the builder to make him provide also for the extra areas constructed or put up by the members Ofcourse all this is subject to project feasibility If due to giving area from the builder's sale component, the project becomes inviable for him, then he would not show interest So the interest of both the builder and society need to be balanced",

        "full_text": "Online financial fraud involving malicious application and fake WhatsApp groups. I, Kathir, was a member of a WhatsApp group named \"D01 - Alankit Limited Securities Stock Learning Group\" and was lured to install an Android application claiming to provide VIP Account trading services. I deposited a total of Rs. 227,000 for Prime stocks. On 30th August 2024, after the last transaction, the WhatsApp group was deleted, and I was unable to withdraw my money. Realizing I was cheated, I immediately reported the incident to the Cyber Crime Cell and provided all the valid transaction documents. This report was acknowledged with the number & Subsequently, I submitted all the documents with a written complaint to the Whitefield police station, where an FIR was registered in Bangalore Cyber Crime Police Station. Further Developments: (self Investigation) After the initial complaint, I was contacted again by one of the group admins and invited to join another WhatsApp group, \"D02 - Alankit Limited Securities Stock Learning Group.\" I joined this group with the intention of gathering further evidence, noting down the members and other details related to the fraudulent activities. The malicious application used for this scam was still on my mobile phone. I used it as the starting point for further investigation and employed various tools to collect data, which allowed me to identify their domain name, server certificate, and IP addresses where the application is hosted. Communication with Amazon AWS Security Team: To ensure the malicious activities of this group were reported to the proper authorities, I sent multiple emails to Amazon AWS's Security Team & reported the domain & IP details to Amazon AWS. Now, the questions are: 1. What should i do next? 2. What will be the action from Police Side? 3. Will they Freeze the Bank Account to where i have transferred the money? 4. Should i provide all the details which i have collected to the Inspector ? Please guide me. As usually people say, if money is lost on cyber crime, you will never get it back, here in my case i have transferred the money using IMPS on 8 transactions to 4 bank accounts. I assume this would be valid to trace them but i am not sure of the legal difficulties / practicality. Thanking you all in advance, Experts advice would be greatly appreciated.",

            "you should submit all the details you collected to the police 2) police would conduct investigations 3) they can freeze bank accounts of culprits",
            "You have already lodged a criminal complaint against the said persons or group and the cyber crime police are into action. While so, whatever reason you may cite, but the acts of yours by joining the same group in another whatsapp group may show you in a bad light because on one side you have given a complaint against them and on the other side you have joined hands with the same group again, that too without informing your intention to do so to the police. However when you participate the investigation with the police you may better all the details you collected against them and wait for the police to take suitable action as per law. The decision to freeze their account is the discretion of the police",
            "1. You can also lodge a complaint before the Economic Offence Wing after giving all the details 2. Police will investigate the case after getting proper information from you. 3. Yes, 4. Yes,",
            "Dear Client, Keep on working with the Cyber Crime Cell and police to submit all the findings such as the transactions, details on the malicious application, and communication with the group admins. They will probably investigate according to your FIR, possibly contacting the banks that have been involved. They may also ask the respective accounts that you transfer the money to be frozen if they have enough evidence of fraud. Give all the found information to the investigating officer, including technical information pointing to such things as domain names and the IP addresses since they help in tracking the culprits. These are the Information Technology Act of the year 2000 and sections 420IPC and other sections that deals with computer related crimes. Be consistent in contacting the police and possibly seek advice from a cybercrime attorney concerning your rights and the chances of reimbursement of lost funds. Hope you find this answer beneficial for resolving the dispute."

Separating the two portions of the building into independent properties by removing the existing common staircase without compromising the building's structural integrity Respected Sir: The 3-storey residential building was constructed by two sisters by mutual consent around 15 years back in Visakhapatnam city. However, the two have now agreed to remove the common staircase conjoining the two buildings and render it into two separate independent properties, if possible. The building presently has a shop on each side of the building on the ground floor and flats on the first and second floors. The ground floor, first and second floor units are designed and constructed by the two owners independently with only the common staircase joining the two portions of the building. Theoretically, by removing the common staircase completely, the two portions will stand as independent buildings on their respective sites. Practically, however, the common staircase was built as a common structure between the two thus forming part of the main structure for the two portions when it was originally designed and constructed. By removing the present common staircase, both owners will have to construct their own independent separate staircases using the available space in their respective sites. I would, therefore, be grateful for your advice if it is advisable to remove the common staircase to make the two portions independent without compromising the building’s overall structural integrity. Subject to feasibility of the above by addressing the structural issues with appropriate solutions, who should our first contact to provide us a feasibility report so that we could proceed further with an appropriate legal agreement or memorandum of understanding to proceed further with the mission.

            "Dear Client, You can file a petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in the High Court to quash the FIR filed under the SC/ST Act. The key argument would be that the FIR is an afterthought and has been filed with malafide intentions, as the accused had already pleaded guilty in a prior case for the same incident. You can argue that the accused is attempting to misuse the provisions of the SC/ST Act to harass you, a public servant, and to seek vengeance after pleading guilty to the earlier charges. Gather all relevant evidence, including the prosecution report, the accused’s guilty plea, and any communications or RTI replies related to the initial incident. This evidence can support your claim that the SC/ST FIR is frivolous and meant to obstruct justice. Engage a lawyer who specializes in criminal law and has experience dealing with SC/ST Act cases.

The landlord has filed a complaint with police asking for eviction. Now his daughter and he are trying to frame a false case saying I let my dog free to bite them. Neither have I let the dog free nor has it bitten them. Infact, none of them have come to premises which I have rented, after 2nd July 2024. The police is constantly asking me to join the investigation and saying there is nothing called TDS which is applicable on rent payment of 2.4 lakhs. In my case, I am paying 3 lakhs per year.

        "full_text": "Parking in apartment. Dear Sir, I had booked the flat in Ahmedabad with one of the reputed builder in Jan 2017 and sale deed executed on 29th May 2017 post introduction of RERA. The core issue is at the time of flat booking builder was charging Rs 1 lac for open parking space ( in the name of parking area development charges ) and as i a was short of fund i choose to opt out from paying 1 lac extra for open parking. After taking the possession i realized that it will be difficult to manage without allocated parking space and i had wrote to them about allocated parking which they refuse saying they are out of space and forced me to buy covered parking ( Stilt ) @ 2.5lcs which i could not afford at that time ( I have mail communication with devloper in this regards ) after society formation in August 2020, society management committee took over the office and they issued RFID tags only who had opted for parking space ( as data shared by Builder )and denied my vehicle to enter the premises. since then i am managing with NOC for parking from my neighbor who are resident out of India. It is difficult for me to manage and also the sale the flat in absence of allotted car parking. Society committee is also not helping and allotting car parking to me stating society is non profit organization and cant make money by renting or selling it to those who have no allocated space. Society is having an lots of empty parking available which is vacant however resolution is passed in AGM to not to allocate the space to anybody and keep it empty. I have written multiple mail to mangement with seeking a allotment of parking space but non of the mail answered. also off the record they saying that there is no legel provision for soceity to allocate the parking as society is non profit entity and can sell or allot the parking. Pls advise the legal option for this .",

You will have to take this issue to the district deputy registrar of cooperative societies having jurisdiction over your society. File a complaint",
            "Dear Client, As per RERA, it is now the duty of the builder to disclose and provide parking areas within common spaces. Except if the agreement deed permits selling open parking spaces, which ordinarily is not allowed. Builders cannot also sell the parking spaces independently. When the society is created, it also takes charge of maintaining common spaces which includes parking lots as well. If it has free parking space, the society needs to allot on first come and own basis which is either through a lottery system or as passed in AGM. Failure to issue available parking spaces in this circumstance may be seen as arbitrarily or discriminatory. If the society's actions seem arbitrary, you can file a complaint against the builder for their failure to fulfil obligations before Gujarat RERA Authority as well as approach Registrar of Societies. You can also think of filling a civil suit or complaint with the Consumer Forum for deficiency in service. Before seeking redress via the law, it might also be worth compiling evidence or trying to mediate with your society. You should also consult with a local property lawyer expert in RERA to society law who may guide you."

Of delhi high court and demanded that untill we are paid the cost we will not proceed with cross as its our right to get the cost. The arguments on this application is completed in which wife advocate refused ro pay and orally said that giving cost is not mamdatory in CPC. He also said that there is other laws in which we can demand cost but we cannot stop proceedings. Judge asked us why we dont want to proceed and we told court that we have given the ruling and the case cannot proceed untill we are paid. Now my question is 1. Are we not under our right to demand the cost? 2. Is the opposite party oral submission correct? 3. Can court inpose cost on us because we have said no to proceed in cross? 4. Whats the use of imposing cost if its not paid ? Will this non payment not lower the capability of court order ?? 5.

Since, the Court has imposed cost , then it is the duty to direct the opposite party to comply the order of the court 5. Depend upon the discretion of the Court.",
            "Dear Client, You have the right to seek the costs the court met out to your wife for the delay in the proceedings which the court is entitled to impose under Section 35 of the CPC so as to minimize delays and avoid hinderance of judicial processes. To my understanding, the oral submission made by your wife’s advocate suggesting that payment of costs is not compulsory is wrong; once the costs have been ordered the parties are legally entitled to pay. The court cannot punish the refusing party for their refusal to proceed with the cross-examination until the costs awarded by the court are paid, as you have the right to demand payment first. Imposing costs are done for compliance with the court orders and non-payment affects the authority of the court. The expected outcome of a reserved Order should be in your favour because the court will order your wife to honour the Order and pay the outstanding costs before the continuation of the proceedings. In general, you have solid grounds for insisting on following the court order concerning costs. Hope this answer solves your problem."

However, since this is a transfer between family members, some societies may waive the fee or charge a reduced amount. According to the model bye-laws of cooperative housing societies in Maharashtra, the maximum transfer fee that can be levied is usually around ₹500, though it can vary based on the specific rules of your society. It is advisable to check with your society's managing committee or refer to the society's bye-laws to get the exact amount and any possible exemptions for transfers within the family.",

The land could theoretically be reclaimed by the original owners if it is determined that such a transaction was invalid. For the houses that are already constructed on this land, if it turns out no legal transaction has taken place then those who built their homes will have to choose between eviction (if they cannot negotiate with the rightful owners) or negotiation. And then, the Government could also revoke sale of those and constructions on these would be as good as squatters in a forest. The parties should perform a comprehensive legal due diligence of the GPAs and check their legality before establishing that as providing any tittle interest. The best idea is to handle the difference of opinion in a friendly way but if that cannot be done, then maybe we have to look on taking it into court where it will bring an absolute judgment about who owns what."

        "full_text": "Legal advice regarding harassment and non-compliance by housing society. I am reaching out to seek your legal advice on a matter of significant concern that has been causing me substantial mental distress. I am a retired NRI senior citizen, aged 76, with a strong belief in the rule of law. Despite my age, I am prepared to pursue all necessary legal avenues to address the issues I have been facing with my housing society in Worli, Mumbai, where I own two flats—one in my wife’s name and the other in my daughter’s name, both of which are rented out. To give you a brief overview: 1. During the possession process, the builder collected over ₹20 lakhs for each flat, from over 500 flat owners in the tower, without providing the financial accounts to the society. This lack of transparency raises concerns about mismanagement or misappropriation of funds, yet the society’s managing committee has taken no action. 2. The society’s secretary, Mr. KS, has been demanding illegal payments from NRI members, particularly those who have rented out their flats. He raised a false bill of ₹1,25,000 for each of my flats and instructed security to bar my tenants from entering the premises until the payment was made. Society raised false bills on behalf of builder, which I rightly refused to pay. As per the law, once a society is formed, it has no legal right to recover any outstanding amounts of the builder, and as per the law the society is not an agent of the builder. This caused immense mental harassment and distress to me and my tenants, forcing me to pay the amount under protest. 3. I lodged a complaint with the Deputy Registrar, who ruled in my favor on 29/12/2023, stating that the money was illegally collected and should be adjusted against future maintenance bills. Despite multiple reminders and even attending a general body meeting, the society has not complied with the order. Instead, they have falsely claimed that I have outstanding arrears and have added overdue interest to my latest maintenance bill. Despite the Registrar's order, the society has not adjusted the amount and continues to send me maintenance bills, now falsely claiming that I have outstanding arrears and charging overdue interest. This is despite the fact that all my bills have been paid on time. This ongoing situation is causing me immense mental harassment and adversely affecting my health. This entire situation has not only caused severe mental harassment but is also taking a toll on my health. I have done everything within my power, including engaging with the police and escalating the matter to higher authorities, but the society’s managing committee continues to act with blatant disregard for the law. My Questions: What legal or criminal actions can I take against the secretary and the managing committee for their continuous harassment, illegal demands, and failure to comply with the Registrar’s order? Under which laws can I file a case to hold them accountable for the mental trauma and harassment they have caused me? I",

You can consider filing civil suit claiming damages for causing harassment and trauma to you.",

If the society's managing committee continues to ignore the Registrar's order, you can consider filing a Contempt of Court petition in the High Court. This petition will be based on the society's willful disobedience of the lawful order passed by the Registrar, which amounts to contempt of a judicial authority. Given the harassment and illegal demands, you may also consider filing a criminal complaint against the secretary and the managing committee under section 383, 406 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code. You can also file a civil suit for damages for mental harassment and defamation. Under tort law, you may claim compensation for the mental agony, distress, and damage to your reputation caused by the society's actions If the society still does not comply, escalate the matter by filing a writ petition or contempt petition in the High Court. Engage a lawyer experienced in cooperative housing society matters and criminal law to draft and file the necessary complaints and petitions.",

The orders by the registrar concerned will be a substantial documentary evidence to fight your case If they have already collected any excess amount you can even seek for refund of the unjustified excess amount collected from you. The Deputy registrar's orders cannot be executed by filing any execution petition but the orders passed by the Dy. Registrar will be a substantial evidence to convince the court about the unilateral and arbitrary as well as illegal or unlawful acts done by the society against you, hence you may have to approach civil court as suggested.

Per acre land INR 6,50,000 was awarded by the Karnataka Government at the time of acquisition. Due to corrupt KIADB officials, even after we produced the list of documents soon after we received the notice to claim the compensation, KIADB officials didn't release the compensation in 2007. We had to approach Karnataka Lokayutya to claim the compensation. After receiving the Lokayukta order in 2010, KIADB officials deposited compensation amount in 3 instalments (3 months delay in each deposit). While depositing the amount, KIADB officials didn't pay any compensation towards the building, trees, well (which is mentioned in the notice given to us by the KIADB in 2007). This amount is not paid to us till date. Most importantly, since 2007, there is no development has happened in the acquired land (apart from levelling the land and putting the fence to the acquired land, I have the evidence).

            "In 2010, the Supreme Court had ruled that the government cannot be compelled to reconvey the land to the original owner if the same can be utilised for any public purpose other than the one for which it was acquired. In another ruling in 2016, the apex court also said that authorities can return the land to the original owner in case its transfer to a third party leads to profiteering. “When the land sought to be acquired for a public purpose is allowed to be transferred to private persons, any administrative action or private transaction could be held to be vitiated by fraud. There is no legal sanction for such action,” it added. In case of land acquired under the 2013 law, land that remains unutilised for five years can be returned to the original owner. Section 101 of the 2013 law says that such land “shall be returned to the original owner or owners or their legal heirs”. The law also allows for enlisting the land into a government-prescribed land bank.

In para 2, this Court observed thus:- \"2........ We do not think that this Court would be justified in making direction for restitution of the land to the erstwhile owners when the land was taken way back and vested in the Municipality free from all encumbrances. We are not concerned with the validity of the notification in either of the writ petitions. It is axiomatic that the land acquired for a public purpose would be utilized for any other public purpose, though use of it was intended for the original public purpose. It is not intended that any land which remained should be restituted to the erstwhile owner to whom adequate compensation was paid according to the market value as on the date of the notification. Under these circumstances, the High Court was well justified in refusing to grant relief in both the writ petitions",
            "the compensation was paid to you in 2010 . you should have claimed interest at that time for delay in payment of compensation and not after 14 years t",
            "Dear Client, The land so acquired by the government cannot be reclaimed once the landowners have accepted the compensation and it continues to remain in possession of the land acquisition authority for whatever purpose. However, if the land abates utility and no development has been undertaken or carried out on the acquired land fee, if necessary, you can file a legal case challenging the acquisition on the ground that after such a long lapse of time the purpose mentioned in the order of acquisition was not accomplished. As far as the compensation awarded relates to land, building, trees, wells etc, since you have not been paid for all these, you may approach the court and file a plaint to claim this compensation. During award of compensation, if there is a delay in making payment of the same, interest is payable at the rate of 9 per cent for the first year and 15 per cent p.a. for the subsequent periods which runs from the date the land was taken possession of till the time the compensation is paid. You can claim interest on account of the delayed compensation deposits. Interest cannot be waived and is a statutory entitlement. Payment of tax deducted under the Income-tax Act, 1961 on compensation received in respect of compulsory acquisition of urban agricultural land should be paid to the agriculturalist. There is no requirement of TDS for rural agricultural land. However, supposing the compensation is received, in such cases also, TDS is deducted as per the provisions of the Act."

My father is a retired state government pensioner. He initially joined as a Class III officer and was subsequently promoted to Class II. Later, he was promoted to Class I rank, but only at the age of 54. Since this promotion occurred after the age of 40, I was previously eligible for inclusion in the NCL and accordingly availed of the OBC reservation as per the Office Memorandum regarding reservation for SCs, STs, OBCs, PwDs, and EWS in Central Government posts and services. He retired at the age of 58 and currently has the following sources of income: 1. Monthly pension post-retirement. 2. Interest earned on Provident Fund and Gratuity received after retirement, plus some savings. 3. Monthly salary from a contractual position in the same government department where he worked. The contract is renewed every 11 months. For the above scenario, there is no clear mention of rules in the office memorandum. Therefore, I am currently uncertain whether I can avail myself of the reservation. I wish to know if the rank criteria still apply or if the income criteria now apply.

            "- As per law, a Government Employee of Class III or below class 3 officers are eligible for OBC Quota., and the salary/ income of the government employees are not to be taken into consideration for considering the OBC NCL category certificate. - Since your father was working under Class III , then even his tenure of job , you was entitled to get the non-creamy OBC Certificate. - Hence, the same status will continue after the retirement of your father and his present income from the pension will not considered , and hence you are entitled for getting OBC-NCL certificate.",
            "You are entitled to OBC NL certificate as your father was retired state govt employee and at age of 40 was not class I officer 2) his pension is not included in determining your non creamy layer status",
            "Dear Client, OBC NCL status is based on the job of parents or income, these marks are not decided discursively. Job is not only parameter. let’s say if your father get a class I Promotion after age of 40 then he will also be coming under as Non-Creamy Layer. Thus, as per this criterion you are still OBC Non-Creamy Layer. According to latest rules, Income limit for the unreserved candidates with no disability is Rs 8 lakh per annum. However, income from salaries & the agriculture land shall not considered as counting this revenue. It only does not consider revenue from incomes like business, professional income and other revenues. There is no income limit included for pension. This is because the pension counts as income, and any amount of salary will be excluded from deciding your apparent status for NCL purposes. Interest Income on Provident Fund, Gratuity and other saving may be included while calculating the limit of income. Nonetheless, this might only drive the overall income over Rs. 8 lakh thresholds (based on quantum of investment). Earnings of a contractual job even in the same govt department would be invariably salary income so. This should not affect your eligibility as salary income is excluded from the criteria of NCL. If the total interest income from PF, gratuity & savings is less than 8 lakh pa you may come under the scope of OBC NCL."

        "full_text": "Finance agencies trying to include co-applicant fraudulently after the applicant committed suicide. Hello Sir, My father has taken few unsecured business loans and we are not aware about his business or what's happening with his business and we were never involved in it. Me or my mother is not even partners. It's a proprietorship firm just on my father's name. Since he is not a calculated person and wasting money on bad habits, we have already given a public paper notice few years ago not to give any debts to him and we are not responsible for his debts if someone lends him money. Now my father has committed suicide because of unable to repay the debt and one of the finance agency mentioned that my mom is the co-applicant and they are asking to send the Aadhar copy of my mom and a copy of bank account as they want to apply for insurance claim. My mom never signed any application for any loan as co-applicant. Should I send the copy of aadhar and bank passbook to them ? I feel they are trying to include her as co-applicant to recover the loan later incase insurance may reject the claim as suicidal death. Please help. Can they really include my mom now as a co-applicant ? We have only single house and it seems they are trying to recover loan by suing on it which is a joint self acquired property of me and my mom. As the outstanding amount is around 1L, do they really go to court on it for this less amount ? And other loans which my father has taken also under 5L and all of them are unsecured business loans. Do these finance agencies approach court to recover them by adding my mom as co-applicant ? What are the chances that they can do this fraud ? I am very much worried.",

            "If your mother was not the co applicant for loan then never send such details. It may be a trap to implicate her as co borrower so that they can pressurise your mother through lawful means to repay the loan of your father. For unsecured loan like this one they cna no go after the house of you after the death of your father. So ignore such calls. They are short of any legal remedy to recover this loan.",

However, you can seek enforcement of the U.S. custody order by filing a petition in an Indian court under Section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which deals with the recognition of foreign judgments. You may file this petition in the High Court or Family Court where your wife and child currently reside in India. While the Indian court will focus on the child's best interests, presenting a certified copy of the U.S. court order and demonstrating that returning to the U.S. aligns with those interests could support your case. Despite potential challenges, such as jurisdictional issues and the Indian court's discretion, a well-argued petition could lead to the enforcement of your custody rights."

        "full_text": "Property law and family arrangement. Party1 is my (Male, 50) family, the counterparty (father,mother, my late brother family). No sister. All are in Pune but originally from Bihar & properties discussed here are in Bihar. My mother is abusive to all not obeying her including husband. I have ten years digital call records to prove. 4 years ago, we sold “CY” Ancestral property (Bihar City) based on written family arrangement(20% to each son, and 30% on father name with my son as nominee, 30% to mother with my late brother’s son as nominee). Tax returns, call etc match to it. “VY” ancestral property (“Khatian property”,Bihar village) was received by my father as share from his cousins 35 years ago through a family settlement. 6 months ago, I agreed to the sale of “VY” ancestral property with the condition that the distribution shall match Family Arrangement for “CY”, and also his own written(2 years back) plan similar to “CY” plan stating 50-50 split between two sons with a gift deed to a helper, agreed by us verbally. (Have records of relatives & non-relatives to confirm 50-50 split). Helper gift done by father recently. 3 weeks ago, my mother fought, and tried to frame me in false case to seize all properties. The counterparty (my father under pressure) joined and planning to deprive me of my rights. They received advance payment in their joint account (I am not in that) despite my objections to them & buyer. In reply to my lawyer’s criminal breach notice, they offered 1/4 share as a charity after “VY” sales is over. They falsely claimed that I received excess payment for “CY” City ancestral property as I was in need so, they adjust excess against “VY” sale. Just now, I have responded with transcript of 10 yrs calls and tax/ bank transactions etc that they are lying. I have withdrawn my assent to the sale of “VY”, and accused them of cheating with proof. (A) Now my old father, under pressure, may say that he won't agree to old plan, verbal agreement etc . Can he do that for “VY” ancestral property or he cannot? I think he can limit me to 1/3 for all remaining Ancestral property? (Note: he gifted helper from “VY” property as per his plan, allowed if coparcener agreed. I agreed as his full written plan to be followed.) (B) My lawyers says(1) criminal breach is valid (2) First file for injunction for “VY”. I want to seek not 1/3 as per law but half as per written plan for “VY”. I have call records, docs etc to prove my point. (3) Partition suit not ok. If I initiate, mothers get share too so, I will be left with quarter share, offered to me. I want nothing if it is not according to written plan. (4) I think for remaining ancestral property (other than “VY”), they can insist to follow the rule of 1/3. (C) My lawyer says that file criminal case in Pune as all parties are based here. If counterparty denies my rights to “VY” property in Pune court, I can happily go to village court as it is more troublesome for them to go to village court. Please advise on three points above.",
        "answers": [
            "1) is written family arrangement registered 2) un registered agreement is not admissible in evidence except for collateral purposes to prove possession 3) you should act as per your lawyer advice as they have gone through written agreement and all other correspondence exchanged till date 4)you can seek stay order restraining sale of property and for declaration that you have x share in property 5) you can file case of criminal breach of trust in Pune",
            "As you don't want partition, you will have to file a declaratory suit seeking a declaration that the verbal agreement is valid and subsisting and for enforcing that agreement against your father Criminal proceedings are a waste of time in such a case",
            "(A) The property so called ancestral property in the village was obtained by your father out of a partition from his cousins hence it cannot be categorized as ancestral property, therefore as per law, if your father is not willing to give any share in it to you or to anyone, then nobody can claim any share in it as a right. (B) Your father's voluntary act of orally agreeing to give any share in the property to you and not honoring it will not come under criminal breach of trust. The call records in your possession are not considered as valid and legally enforceable document to support your claim as what you have mentioned here. Your mention about the written plan is not a document which would be enforceable in law hence if you decide to fight in the court of law on that basis, you will not get any share in this property neither you will be able to win the case which is ab initio not maintainable. (C) if at all you want to lodge any criminal complaint against them then you may have to do so only in the place where the cause of action arose and not on any false promise or misguidance made by anyone.",
            "Dear Client, As \"VY\" is ancestral property, under Hindu Succession Act, 1956, it is co-parcenary property, meaning that all male members (including you and your brother) have an equal right to it by birth. However, your father's share is also ancestral, and he can distribute his share as he pleases during his lifetime. This means he can choose to go against the previous verbal or written family agreements unless those agreements are legally binding. Since there was a written plan similar to the \"CY\" plan that was verbally agreed upon, your father’s ability to alter the distribution depends on whether that plan was legally documented and agreed upon by all coparceners. If it was only verbal, it might be difficult to enforce it legally without strong supporting evidence. If your father decides not to honor the previous plan, the default legal rule would apply, potentially limiting your share to 1/3 of his share in the remaining ancestral property. Filing for an injunction to prevent the sale of \"VY\" property is a valid legal remedy. An injunction can temporarily halt the sale until the dispute is resolved. This would protect your interest while the case is ongoing. File a criminal breach of trust case in Pune if you have substantial evidence to support the claim that your family is dishonestly depriving you of your rightful share. Your lawyer’s advice against filing a partition suit is based on the fact that it would legally entitle your mother to a share, potentially reducing your portion to 1/4, as per Hindu Succession Act, 1956. Filing a criminal case in Pune is feasible since all parties reside there, and it would be more convenient for you. If necessary, be prepared to move the case to the village court in Bihar, which may put additional pressure on the counterparty.",
            "Th issue would be whether it is memorandum of family arrangement or deed of partition 2) if it merely records shares of all family members as per oral settlement it does not require to be stamped and registered 3) if it provides for division of family properties it would be required to be stamped and registered and is in admissible in evidence 4) but it is well settled law that it can be used for collateral purposes to show possession of property 5) it does not confer title to property 6) The SC inin the matter of ‘Ravinder Kaur Grewal & Ors vs. Manjit Kaur & Ors’ addressed the question regarding the registration of Memorandum of family settlement In this case, the SC held that in case a memorandum of family settlement is just recording the terms of settlement between the parties that was previously agreed between them then registration of such document is not compulsory as it in itself is not creating or extinguishing any right or title. On the contrary, if the memorandum contains the terms and recitals of family arrangement made under that document then registration of MOFS would be compulsory. In the said judgment, SC reiterated the observations of its earlier judgement that a MOFS prepared after family arrangement was already made for the purpose of recording the information or for the information of the court, is not required to be registered."

        "full_text": "Can a woman move to her parent's home in a different state before/during filing a domestic violence case?. My mother has put up through repeated domestic violence and mental abuse for her entire married life of about 14 years. My father had stopped getting into physical altercations for the past 2 years but stayed mentally abusive. Last night he did it again, and this time a lot worse than the last few times, verbally abusing her repeatedly before choking her without any engagement on her behalf (she did not even curse at him) and then she cursed at him for putting his hands on her and he slapped her with full force, so much that she felt her face go numb and it hit one of her eyes as well. He also threatened her that he's not afraid of going to jail so I am very concerned for her safety because he cannot be trusted and may do anything if he figures out that he is in any sortof legal danger. My mother wishes to pursue a legal case against him and file for a divorce but she is feeling very cornered in that particular city and state (Lucknow, UP) because it is very close to my father's home town and it has only been 5 years living there so she barely knows the city and had no close relatives living nearby. If she were to pursue a legal case she would have a terrible time because it would be almost impossible to get out of my father's reach. My father could also bring over his side of the family from his home town and make my mother's life miserable with harrassment. I would like her to move to her parent's house in Jabalpur, MP for the duration of her court case and maybe even afterwards because that is where she grew up and she will have a support system around her to protect her and would be familiar with the city. My father is very well aware that my mother is helpless in lucknow because he knows she doesn't know any people that can protect her. Can she move to her parent's house and then file the complaints from over there? Or if she files an FIR in lucknow, can she then do the rest of the legal proceedings from Jabalpur?

An FIR can be filed at the place of occurrence of the crime. However, if she moves to Jabalpur, she can still file a complaint there and seek a transfer of the case to Jabalpur.

She can file for divorce in the family court in Jabalpur, as under the Hindu Marriage Act, she can file a divorce petition where she is currently residing. It is crucial to engage a lawyer who specializes in family law and domestic violence cases. The lawyer can guide her through filing complaints, applying for protection orders, and initiating divorce proceedings.

According to Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), a case can be filed where the defendant resides or where the cause of action arises. This means she has the flexibility to choose the location that is most convenient for her means either lucknow or jabalpur any of them. Once the FIR is filed, she can coordinate with her lawyer to handle the proceedings from Jabalpur. Many legal processes can be managed remotely, and her lawyer can represent her in court if necessary. However, it might be beneficial for her to move to her parent’s house for support and safety.

You can resort to legal action by first issuing a legal notice demanding the return of the title documents, if they fail to comply or do not respond then you can approach consumer commission for deficiency in service as well as return of the title documents.",
            "Dear Sir/Madam, Thank you for your query regarding the retrieval of your property title deed from the State Bank of India (SBI) after the closure of your agricultural loan. Based on the information provided, I will provide an expert legal response to assist you in this matter. Under the Indian laws, when a borrower takes a loan from a bank and provides immovable property as security, the bank holds the original title deed of the property until the loan is fully repaid. Once the loan is closed, the bank is legally obligated to return the original title deed to the borrower. In your case, since you have closed the loan in 2013 and have not received the original title deed back from the bank, you have the following legal options: Send a Legal Notice: You can send a legal notice to the concerned SBI branch, demanding the return of your original title deed within a specified time frame (usually 15-30 days). The notice should clearly state the loan details, the date of closure, and the fact that you have not received the original title deed despite repeated requests. File a Consumer Complaint: If the bank fails to respond to the legal notice or does not return the title deed, you can file a consumer complaint against SBI before the appropriate District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Kerala. Banks are considered \"service providers\" under the Consumer Protection Act, and failure to return the title deed after loan closure can be considered a deficiency in service. Approach the Banking Ombudsman: You can also file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for your region. The Banking Ombudsman has the power to pass an order directing the bank to return the title deed or provide compensation. File a Civil Suit: If the above options do not yield a favorable result, you can file a civil suit against SBI in the appropriate court in Kerala, seeking the return of the original title deed or compensation for the loss/damage caused due to the bank's negligence. It is important to note that you should have proper documentation, such as the loan closure certificate, to support your claim. Additionally, you should keep records of all communications with the bank regarding the retrieval of the title deed. Regards, Arunkumar Khedia Advocate Bombay Highcourt",
            "Dear Client. Send a formal letter to the bank's branch manager requesting a detailed explanation of the situation. In the letter, state that you did not collect the original title deed and that the bank has confirmed it cannot locate the document. Request that they acknowledge in writing that the title deed was lost while in their custody. If the branch does not resolve your issue, escalate the matter to the bank's regional office or the customer grievance redressal cell. Every bank, including SBI, has a specific process for handling customer complaints. If the bank fails to resolve the issue within 30 days, you can file a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman. You can file the complaint online, by email, or through a letter. If the above steps do not yield results, you may send a legal notice to the bank, demanding the return of your title deed or appropriate compensation for the loss of the original document. At the same time you can also apply for a duplicate title deed.",
            "- Since, the loan amount already refunded by you and the bank has issued a loan closure certificate , then the bank is under obligation to return the mortgaged registered documents to you. - You can send a legal notice to the bank for the same , and if not positive response then file a complaint before the Consumer forum against the bank on the ground of deficiency of service , and thereby you can also claim compensation for the harassment."

        "full_text": "Registration of property from grandfather to father. I am writing to seek your assistance with a matter regarding the registration of property that originally belonged to my late grandfather Background My grandfather passed away 20 years ago. Before his death, he equally distributed his property among his four sons, including my father, and documented this in a will. My father has three living brothers, one deceased brother, and three living sisters, with one deceased sister. At the time of property registration for my father’s brothers, my father signed the necessary documents, allowing them to register their shares. Current Issue: My father now wishes to register his share of the property. However, one of his brothers is refusing to sign the necessary documents unless my father gives him a share of the property. I would like to confirm whether the signature of the deceased brother's children is also required for this registration process. Questions: What steps should be taken to register the property in my father's name, given that we have a will? How should we address the demand made by my father’s brother for a share in exchange for his signature? Is the signature of my deceased uncle’s children necessary for the registration? I would greatly appreciate your guidance on these matters.",
        "answers": [
            "apply for probate of grand father will . enclose affidavit of one of attesting witness probate is judicial proof that will is genuine 3) if your uncles / deceased brother children contest will it would be converted into testamentary suit 4) amicable settlement is best option",
            "Dear client, I’m sorry to hear about the difficulties you’re facing. Let’s address your questions step by step. Steps to Register the Property in Your Father’s Name 1. Verify the Will: Ensure that the will is legally valid and has been probated. Probate is the legal process through which a will is validated by the court. 2. Gather Necessary Documents: Collect all required documents, including the will, death certificate of your grandfather, identity proofs, and any previous property registration documents. 3. Legal Heir Certificate: Obtain a legal heir certificate if not already done. This certificate will list all the legal heirs of your grandfather. 4. No Objection Certificate (NOC): Obtain NOCs from all legal heirs, including the children of the deceased brother and sister. This is crucial to avoid any future disputes. 5. Approach the Sub-Registrar: Submit all the documents to the sub-registrar’s office for the registration process. The sub-registrar will verify the documents and proceed with the registration. Addressing the Demand for a Share • Negotiation: Try to negotiate with your father’s brother to resolve the issue amicably. Sometimes, a mutual agreement can be reached without legal intervention. • Legal Notice: If negotiation fails, consider sending a legal notice through your lawyer, stating that the demand for a share is unjustified and that you are prepared to take legal action if necessary. • Court Intervention: As a last resort, you can approach the court to enforce the will and compel the brother to sign the necessary documents. Signature of Deceased Uncle’s Children Yes, the signatures of the deceased uncle’s children are necessary. They are legal heirs and have a right to the property. Their consent is required to ensure that there are no future disputes regarding the property. Additional Steps • Consult a Lawyer: Given the complexities involved, it is advisable to consult a lawyer who specializes in property law. They can guide you through the process and help address any legal challenges. • Documentation: Keep all communications and documents well-organized. This will be helpful if the matter escalates to legal proceedings. Thank you. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.",
            "The Will itself is a title document hence no further steps namely a registered deed on his name again is not necessary. He has to transfer the revenue records to his name on the basis of the registered Will towards his share in the property, of course the revenue department may insist on NOC from other legal heirs of your deceased grandfather to this. If anyone is not willing to furnish NOC then your father can file a suit to declare his title on the basis of the Will or he can file a probate petition for grant of probate to Will by which he can transfer the revenue records to his name.",
            "It is not possible to answer without first seeing the Will You will have to prepare a family tree with exact dates of death of your father's siblings If your deceased uncle died after your grandfather then the uncle would get a share under the Will. And upon death of that uncle, his share will go to his children. And if your deceased uncle died before your GF, then depending on what is mentioned in the Will, his children would be entitled to claim a share...however that will become clear only once you show the Will to a lawyer along with family tree",
            "- Since, your grandfather distributed his property by way of Will in favor of his four sons, and hence they have equal share in the property - Further, after getting the respective share in the property , then can sell their share without taking the consent of others - Hence, no consent is needed from the legal heirs of deceased brother for the registration or dealing of his shares - You father can apply for mutation of his shares property after submitting the death certificate of his deceased father and Will. - Further, if there is dispute over the Will , then Probate is necessary from the Court."

Since your mother’s business generates ₹4 lakhs annually, this amount will be included in the assessment. For backward class benefits, the total family income should generally be less than ₹8 lakhs per annum. This means the combined income from all sources must not exceed this threshold.

I believed their intentions and financed 50% of the flat cost (around 15 lakhs out of 30 lakh). They got possession of flat in Oct 2022. Post the possession, their behaviour changed.

Further, he has defamed by way of libel and slander quite often linking me with his wife. Not only did I lose money and trust, I have lost peace of mind, and I am also emotionally hurt, which has led to some extent of stress and depression. Please suggest what action can I take on him and his family.",
        "answers": [
            "Dear Sir, I understand that you have been through a very difficult and emotionally traumatic situation. Based on the details provided, it appears that there are multiple legal issues involved, and you may have grounds to take action against the family. However, before proceeding, it is crucial to gather all relevant evidence and documentation to support your claims. Firstly, regarding the financial aspect, since you have invested a substantial amount of money (₹15 lakhs) towards the purchase of the flat, you may have a claim for the recovery of that amount. If there was a written agreement or understanding regarding the investment and the promised care in return, it would strengthen your case. In the absence of a written agreement, you may still have a claim based on the principles of equity and unjust enrichment. Secondly, the allegations of defamation (libel and slander) made by the husband against you are serious offenses under the BNS. Defamation involves making false statements that harm the reputation of another person. If the husband has made such false statements about you having an affair with his wife, you may have grounds to file a criminal complaint for defamation under BNS. Thirdly, the emotional distress, stress, and depression caused by the family's actions may also give rise to a claim for compensation under the law of torts. You may be able to seek damages for the mental anguish and emotional harm suffered due to their actions. To proceed with legal action, I would recommend the following steps: Gather all relevant evidence and documentation, including any written agreements, communications (emails, text messages, etc.), and witness statements, if available. Consult with an experienced civil and criminal lawyer in your area to evaluate the strength of your case and the appropriate legal remedies available. For the recovery of the invested amount, you may file a civil suit in the appropriate court, seeking the return of the money along with interest and any other damages. For the defamation allegations, you may file a criminal complaint with the local police station, providing evidence of the false statements made by the husband. Regarding the emotional distress and mental anguish, you may include a claim for damages in the civil suit or file a separate suit for compensation under the law of torts. It is important to note that legal proceedings can be complex and time-consuming, and the outcome will depend on the strength of the evidence and the interpretation of the law by the courts.

Will the property rights originally devolved upon my grandmother be devolving upon myself and my mother since no partition was executed till date by my grandmother? This query is only for self-acquired properties of my late father. Though on a different context, I read that the Hindu Succession Act amendment of 2005 applies retroactively being a birth right for a girl child. With the same logic wouldn't this case also retroactively apply ? Amendment of Section 15 - In The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (Central Act 30 of 1956), in section 15, after clause (b) of subsection (2), the following clause shall be inserted namely:- (c) any property inherited by a female Hindu from her predeceased son shall devolve, not upon the other heirs referred to in sub-section (1) in the order specified therein, but upon the heir of the predeceased son from whom she inherited the property\".",

            "Dear Client, Laws are presumed to apply prospectively unless there is clear language indicating that they should apply retrospectively. This is particularly true in matters of succession, where the rights of heirs typically vest at the time of the decedent’s death. This amendment does not explicitly state that it applies retrospectively. As such, it would normally apply prospectively to cases of succession occurring after the amendment came into force. At the time of your grandmother’s death in 2014, the amendment had not yet been enacted. Therefore, the devolution of her property would be governed by the laws in effect at that time, which did not include the 2016 amendment. Under the pre-amendment law, the property would typically go to her own heirs, which may include her other children, and not necessarily revert back to the heirs of her predeceased son. The 2005 amendment to the Hindu Succession Act was interpreted by the courts to apply retroactively because it dealt with a daughter’s birthright to coparcenary property. This was a fundamental change recognizing the equal status of daughters. Kerala Amendment (2016), however, deals with the succession of property inherited by a female Hindu from her predeceased son. This does not relate to birthrights but to the specific circumstances of inheritance."

            "Dear Client, Legally, a confirmation deed can be executed at any time, even after a long period, if the original owner is still willing to confirm the transaction. The other parties' plan to get a confirmation deed for only their portion of the land without including your portion is legally possible. The law does not require that a confirmation deed cover all parts of a transaction if the original sale has been divided. Each party can individually confirm their portion with the original owner. However, this could lead to complications, especially if the original owner later disputes your portion of the land or if the other parties withdraw from any joint legal proceedings. The fact that the original owner has fraudulently entered into a lease agreement with another person adds complexity. Joining the deal might be a pragmatic solution if you believe that it will protect your interests and avoid the uncertainty of lengthy court proceedings. However, it is essential to ensure that your portion of the land is also confirmed in the deed, and you should not be left out of any negotiations.

The building has formed a cooperative society and our unit is the only one left under Pagdi Tenancy. We only have one agreement, between my grandmother and the landlord's mother. The landlord’s son has never renewed the agreement since the landlady (his mother) mentioned in the agreement passed away, and my grandmother passed away in 2013. He stopped providing rent receipts, a long time ago, although we have paid the rent. Our last payment was provided as DD, with a request to transfer the tenancy to my name. He took the DD encashed it, and never acknowledged that agreement. And since then to date we haven’t paid him any rent. I am staying with my mom and sister, my dad has passed away! Although, I am the legal heir. We are stuck with no Pagadi tenancy agreement under my name. I have a few questions: 1) Are we eligible to get a unit when redevelopment happens? We don’t have any Pagdi tenancy agreement under our names 2) If he agrees, can I pay him 33% based on the current market valuation, and buy the unit from him? 3) If we deposit the rent in court. I assume, there is a possibility where he could take the money now and then later on when the builder comes in, would be willing to return that money and ask us to vacant the unit.

It does not matter that the rent receipt is still issued in the name of your grandmother who was the original tenant 2. there is no need to pay any money to the landlord's son. however if you want the rent receipt to be issued in your sole name, then you can take noc from other heirs and submit that to the landlord and request him to transfer the rent bill in your name, however for that you dont have to pay full 33% since the heirs get tenancy rights by operation of law and there is no transfer of tenancy to a third party as such. in case you wish to buy the remaining rights of the landlord in the unit then for that he may demand the market value of the unit, since by transferring the remaining rights in the unit, you would become the owner of the unit. 3. what rubbish! just continue to pay the rent to the heir of the deceased landlord and take proper rent receipts from him. If he is not accepting the rent then do a money order in his favour or make an application to the small causes court to deposit the rent in court since the landlord refuses to accept the rent from you. the builder as and when appointed has to recognise the heirs of the deceased tenant and the new rehab unit will be allotted to them only or to any one of them as per the mutual agreement between the heirs",

Although, the land ownership was never transferred in the name of the society. It's still under the landlord's name. Now, he's the one responsible for getting a builder onboard. Had a few questions: - Is there any possibility that the owner/builder refuses to allot us with new units during redevelopment since there's no Pagdi agreement tenancy between myself and the current landlord, if yes then under what conditions? We only have one rent receipt for 1988. That's it! He stopped providing rent receipts after that year onwards. - Is the old agreement signed in 1974, between my grandmother and the owner's grandmother still valid? They both have passed away. We had requested the owner to transfer the Pagdi tenancy agreement onto our name, by providing him a ready agreement along with pending rental as DD. He refused to sign it, and encashed the DD amount! I have a copy of that agreement and DD as well. - Are we eligible to get all the benefits (+30% extra carpet area, etc..), during the redevelopment, just like other units? - Will the Landlord/builder ask to provide the NOC from my aunts and uncle during redevelopment just to intentionally complicate our situation? Since they don't have any rights in this unit. It's a Pagdi tenancy and not ownership The landlord is not willing to provide rent receipts, even after multiple requests. Is the bank transaction with the description being mentioned as rent and month name for example: \"Rent for Jan 2024\" sufficient proof of rent payment, if the matter goes to the court? I'm willing to pay the nominal rent via UPI as per the Pagdi system. Since I don't have the owner's account number. If the owner refunds the amount. I'll put an application in small causes court regarding submitting the rent in court The following documents are still under my deceased grandmother's name: - Pagdi tenancy - Electric and gas bill - Ration card The following documents are under my name: - Passport - Pan card - Aadhar card - Voter ID Should we proceed to change the name for electric, gas, and ration card to my name? Will there be any issue during the redevelopment, if these documents are not under my grandmother's name? Since the existing Pagdi tenancy agreement is under her name.

Whatever existing documents you have and the documents that stand in the name of the original tenant , would suffice However as rightly apprehended by you the landlord may intentionally create complications by requiring you to get the noc of your aunt and uncle who are the other heirs of your GM who was the original tenant. However if they are ok and consenting then you can always take their consent affidavit for record for submission to the landlord or any other authority I don't know under which regulation of the DCPR 2034 the property can be taken up for redevelopment since its held by two entities, the land is owned by the landlord and the flats in the building are owned by the individual tenants (except you) who seem to have formed a society However whenever such redevelopment takes place you will get the benefit of the redevelopment in the form of the new rehab premises in lieu of the old premises held by you at present Just because you do not have ownership right over the flat and still hold tenancy rights, would not mean that you will be denied the redevelopment benefit You should continue paying the rent to the landlord , even if he refuses and does not issue any receipt You can write the amount and month on the covering letter that you would send to the landlord which will be an evidence that you regularly pay the rent. If you want to make payment by UPI ensure that the amount is credited to the correct account standing in the landlord's name. Otherwise you can continue issuing cheque or a DD (for consolidated rent of several months together , say for a year) which is also sufficient. Cheque has a validity period , however when you make a DD the amount would be debited right away to your account. So it's a good thing that you issue DD to the landlord towards rent.",

If there are no specific court orders restricting your movement or requiring you to stay within a certain jurisdiction, you might still be able to apply for the PCC. However, the pending case itself can be a significant hurdle. One potential option is to seek the quashing of the 498A case under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).

        "full_text": "Fake Photos with PM & Other Intimidation Tactics Against Debt Recovery. I lent money (have evidence) to a friend who is now refusing to repay it and has resorted to indirect intimidation tactics. In one meeting, he showed forged photographs with the Prime Minister and the Home Minister, claiming his high ranking IAS friend facilitated the meeting. Later he shared the photographs with me on WhatsApp. I verified their authenticity and found the originals on the Internet from which the fake photographs were made. In a subsequent meeting, which I recorded for evidence, he openly boasted about his influence and his ability to use violence: 1. He narrated a story of using extortion by police through his connections with a high ranking IAS to recover a debt from an individual. 2. He claimed to have caused the transfer of a PCS officer through his connections, which we later learnt was due to the officer's promotion. 3. Most alarmingly, he threatened physical harm to a friend of mine (by breaking his face) because my friend tarnished his image in the society. I have a recording of all the above. Questions: 1. Is showing forged photographs in order to project power and influence an offense? If yes, what kind of offense? 2. Can a case of intimidation be made based on the above evidence, given no direct threat was made to me? 3. Can any other criminal charge be brought based on the recordings I have? 4. What is the likelihood that police would lodge a complaint or FIR for any of the above? What actions would the police take? 5. Anywhere else I can lodge a complaint?",

We paid 6 months rent in advance. Suddenly after 3 months 6 days, he asked her to vacate the apartment within 55 days, saying he needs it for himself (although it seems it is being sold). She needs more time as she doesn't want to rent again and instead wants to purchase a house for stability in old age. (She's happy to purchase the house but landlord hasn't said he's selling or possibly already agreed with somebody) Following is the agreement. Please inform how long can she stay and any tactical options: Whereas ... on Leave and License basis under Section 24 of the MAHARASHTRA RENT CONTROL ACT, 1999. ... 1) Period: That the Licensor hereby grants to the Licensee herein a revocable leave and license, to occupy the Licensed Premises ... without creating any tenancy rights or any other rights, title and interest in favour of the Licensee for a period ... from 01/05/2024 and ending on 28/02/2026 2) License Fee & Deposit:That the Licensee shall pay to the Licensor the following amount per month ... ... 8) No Tenancy: That the Licensee shall not claim any tenancy right ... ... 10) Cancellation: That, Subject to the condition of lock in period (if any), if the Licensee commits default in regular and punctual payments of monthly compensation as herein before mentioned or commit/s breach of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this agreement or if any legislation prohibiting the Leave and License is imposed, the Licensor shall be entitled to revoke and / or cancel the License hereby granted, by giving notice in writing of one month and the Licensee too will have the right to vacate the said premises by giving a notice in writing of one month to the Licensor as mentioned earlier. 11) Possession: That the immediately at on the expiration or termination or cancellation of this agreement the Licensee shall vacate the said premises without delay with all her goods and belongings.

Since the license is valid for a period of three years and that your mother would like to remain here till she finds an alternate accommodation, she can clearly inform this and refuse to vacate even if the landlord issues an eviction notice. If necessary you can file a suit for injunction against the landlord to restrain him from forcibly evicting your mother from the premises other than by due process of law.",
            "Rent payment should be regular and legal notice should be given",
            "It is agreed that there will be added trouble caused due to shifting of the house. But the agreement will prevail as the landlord equally holds the right to demand vacating of the premises upon serving notice as per the stipulated time. You might want to try to settle with the landlord amicably and request for giving additional time .",
            "Dear Client, It can be inferred that the agreement is valid until 28/02/2026, as stated in the contract. The landlord is trying to terminate the agreement prematurely. The Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999 provides protections for tenants from arbitrary eviction. Since your mother has a valid and registered leave and license agreement, the landlord cannot evict her without a legitimate reason that complies with the agreement and law. Since your mother is willing to purchase the property, negotiating directly with the landlord might be beneficial. If the landlord is indeed selling the property, your mother could express her interest in buying it, possibly securing more time to arrange the purchase or a temporary extension. If the landlord insists on eviction without a proper legal basis, your mother can challenge this in court. Given that the agreement explicitly mentions a period until February 2026, the court might provide relief, granting her more time to find a new place or purchase the current one. It is advisable to consult with a lawyer specializing in property law in Maharashtra."

In 2020, the company reversed a commission, claiming an error. My partners said it belonged to another agency, dissuading me from pursuing the matter. I left the partnership in 2021. In 2024, I gained access to the financial records of my partners' agency through the company. These records reveal that the reversed commission was transferred to my partners' new agency, even though it was rightfully ours based on the customer it was linked to. My partners misled me and redirected the commission to their agency. Despite inquiries, neither the company nor my former partners have responded to my emails. I have only the financial records of both agencies, which I received from the company, as evidence. Questions: 1. Can my former partners be charged with any criminal offense for diverting the commission and misleading me? 2. Are the financial records from the company sufficient to prove guilt? 3.

My Grand Father (GF) has some properties in his name has transferred to me by registered gift deed on Aug,2022. My GF had got these properties after instate died of My Great grandfather. Currently my Grand Father & Grand Mother are alive. My GF has 2 sons. Younger one had died at the age of 20 years without marriage. Elder one is my father. My father has 1 son (My self) and 1 daughter. I was married and I have 1 son & 1 daughter. My sister has 1 daughter. 1st my sister had sent a legal notice for portion of his share. For that legal notice I replied through lawyer stating that \" Supreme Court had categorically held that, when the great grandfather, died intestate and on his death the properties were succeed and he will become absolute owner of such property and in his life time, he can gift the property to any one he likes. As the said Gift, the subject property will become his self-acquired property\" there after my sister become silent. Now my father had sent the summons to GF & to me stating that \" The properties comes under Ancestral property and he want to his share of 1/9th\". Unfortunately, the lawyer who had replied to my sister legal notice has died, hence I appointed the new lawyer and he wants more clarification on how the properties become self-acquired. (Also, we are referring Uttam Singh vs Subagh sing case of 2016) Hence please provide the more clarification how properties become self-acquired & also please elaborate on Four generation concept (Since we are having 4 generation Grand Father, Father, Son & Grandson)",

            "It is not an ancestral property either in your hands or in your father's hands or in the hands of your grandfather. Your grandfather inherited his share of property out of his father's property hence it becomes your grandfather's self acquired property. Therefore your grandfather was right in transferring his property to his grandson i.e., you because being an absolute owner he has full rights to dispose his property to anyone of his choice and by any mode, to which nobody has a right to challenge. The ancestral property is a property that remains undivided for at least four generations within a Hindu Joint Family. Ancestral property in a Hindu Joint Family spans four generations, remains undivided with equal shares, and is inherited by birth, not death. In your case the next generation of your great grandfather has inherited the intestate property thereby the nature of ancestral property stands automatically extinguished. The reply what your lawyer gave to your sister's legal notice in this regard is proper and perfect you can adopt the reply ion the same lines. The property transferred to you by your grandfather is your own and self acquired property hence the claim made by your father is not maintainable, at least not during the lifetime of your grandfather.",

            "Since your grandfather was the only son and also his mother was the other legal heir, it is presumed taht your grandfather inherited the entire property and got it transferred to his name hence it becomes his self acquired property. A property inherited by a son from his father is not an ancestral property. Subsequently the son had divided his property to his children or upon his intestate death if the property was inherited by his legal heirs then also it cannot be considered as ancestral property. Therefore for any reason it is not an ancestral property.

A replacement cheque was issued, but it was only signed by my wife. My wife subsequently left the partnership, and the remaining partners are now refusing to repay the loan. Can I invoke Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the remaining partners by depositing the replacement cheque signed solely by my wife?",
        "answers": [
            "You can file but in that case your wife being the erstwhile partner will also have be sued .",
            "Your wife was a partner in that company then hence she signed it in the capacity of the partner. Every partner is liable, jointly with all the other partners and also severally, for all acts of the firm done while he is a partner. If the firm cannot pay, the creditors are likely to ask the individual partners to pay. Partners have joint liability for the firm's debts. This means that each partner is liable for the whole balance of the firm's debts. However, any payments made towards a firm's debt will reduce the balance owed by each partner. Recently, the Supreme Court of India (“Supreme Court”) in S.P. Mani and Mohan Dairy v. Dr. Snehalatha Elangovan held that vicarious liability can be imposed on the partners of a firm when specific averments are made in the complaint as to the status of the partner qua the firm. The Supreme Court also clarified that a complaint filed under Sections 138 and 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (“NI Act”) can be quashed if the accused produces unimpeachable and incontrovertible evidence to show that the person could not have been concerned with issuance of the dishonored cheque.",
            "If your wife has already left the partnership, how can she sign the cheque now on behalf of the firm? Moreover a cheque is valid only for 3 months. It does not make sense to present that cheque for payment now.",
            "Dear Client, Since the replacement cheque was signed solely by your wife, the first legal issue is whether this cheque can bind the partnership firm. According to Section 18 of the Partnership Act, 1932, a partner can bind the firm by acts done in the course of the business of the firm. However, once your wife exited the partnership, her authority to bind the firm would generally cease. The cheque issued by a partner who has left the firm may not be enforceable against the firm unless the partnership deed or any subsequent agreement provides otherwise. Under the Partnership Act,1932 all partners are jointly and severally liable for the acts of the firm. However, the liability of the partners is tied to acts done while they were partners as if the cheque is issued after your wife left the firm, and only her signature is on it, then the remaining partners may argue that they are not liable for the cheque. Check the partnership agreement to see if it provides for any specific remedies or liabilities of the partners after a partner leaves the firm. Given the complexities of using a cheque signed by a former partner, you might consider filing a civil suit for the recovery of the loan amount against the firm and the remaining partners.

            "Dear client, Section 143 of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, allows for the conversion of agricultural land to residential or industrial use. This conversion is authorized by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) or Assistant Collector. However, the conversion of land under Section 143 does not automatically change the restrictions on the sale of land originally owned by SC/ST individuals. The sale of such land still requires approval from government officials and must comply with specific conditions set by law. If these conditions are not met, the sale could be considered invalid, and the title might be defective. Given your situation, it would be wise to consult with a legal expert to ensure that all necessary approvals were obtained and that the title is clear before proceeding with the purchase. This will help you avoid any potential legal issues in the future. Thank you. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us Dear Client, Assuming that you are referring to Section 143 of the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, which allows for the conversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural use, Once the land is converted under Section 143, the ownership and transfer of the land are governed by the general provisions applicable to non-agricultural land. This means that the land can be sold to anyone, including non-SC/ST individuals, if it has been legally converted and is no longer subject to the restrictions that apply to agricultural land. For selling converted land, the requirements are generally the same as for non-agricultural land. The seller must ensure that all legal formalities are adhered to, including obtaining any necessary approvals from local authorities or government officials. If you are buying land that has been converted under Section 143 and is now in the possession of a non-SC/ST individual ensure that the conversion was done legally and all requisite approvals and formalities were followed. Conduct a thorough due diligence process, including checking the land records, title deeds, and any potential encumbrances. Consulting with a legal expert or property lawyer is advisable to confirm that the title is clear and there are no legal issues or defects.

I proceeded to file a divorce case on grounds of adultery and cruelty in Jan this year. She never turned up for any of the hearings and she was declared as ex parte. Now my ex and her paramour broke up. So she has come back and taken away my child and is refusing to show her to me on video call also. She also raised a set aside petition by false fully submitting that she never received summons. My wife is an alcoholic and a drug addict and I am very much worried about my child What actions can I take to see my child at the earliest. Can I file habeas corpus? Or can I approach child welfare dept with the evidences of my ex wife partying hard with the child around ?",
        "answers": [
            "a writ of habeas corpus would not ordinarily apply to matters relating to custody, as the usual remedy lies under statutory or personal law, it can be issued in cases warranting the exercise of extraordinary discretionary jurisdiction under Article 226 and that such a writ can be allowed when it is shown that the minor child’s detention is illegal or without legal authority.",
            "Whether your divorce petition still pending or has already been disposed of is not clear. If it is still pending, ask your lawyer to file an interim application seeking custody of your child to protect her from your wife's abuse. You may also file a complaint with the child welfare dept.",
            "You are required to file a child custody petition seeking custody of child on the grounds and reasons you have state here i.e., her acts of adultery, alcoholic and drug addict etc., but you should prove them with at least minimums evidence to prove your allegations. HCP may not be maintainable because the child is in the custody of the mother hence your HCP may be dismissed.",
            "1. File a child custody case immediately. 2. Before that file a Habeas Corpus petition before your High Court seeking production of your child before the Court. 3. Engage a local lawyer having expertise in this field.",
            "Dear Client, You can file a habeas corpus petition to seek the immediate return of your child if you can demonstrate that she is being unlawfully detained or not in a safe environment. You will need to show that your child is being unlawfully held and that you have legal custody rights. Providing evidence of your ex-wife’s condition and the environment in which your child is living can support your case. You can also approach the Child Welfare Department or the Child Protection Services with evidence of your ex-wife's condition and the environment in which your child is living. Since your ex-wife has taken your child and is refusing to allow you to see her, you can file an application for custody in the Family Court. You can request the court to grant you visitation rights or even custody if you can prove that the environment provided by your ex-wife is harmful to the child. If your ex-wife has filed a petition to set aside the ex-parte decree by claiming she never received summons you will need to provide evidence that summons was duly served to counter her claim. Ensure that you document all interactions, keep evidence of your ex-wife's condition, and consult with your lawyer to take the appropriate legal actions.

My Dadaji initially divided his property among his five sons in a complex manner as detailed in his will. However, after consulting a lawyer, the family agreed to equally divide the property among the brothers, effectively nullifying the original will. Dadaji had registered my father's share of the property in my name (Sameer) to prevent my father's second wife—my stepmother, who has a history of greed, bad behaviour, and domestic violence—from inheriting it. Unfortunately, due to the new equal division, I no longer inherit this property. Upon learning that I was out of the will, my stepmother began demanding that another property be bought for her using the proceeds from the sale of Dadaji's property, so she could live near her sisters. My father, a doctor, has already made her a joint owner of one property and a nominee in two others, in addition to the substantial amount of jewellery she has acquired. Despite this, she continues to demand more. My stepmother has never cared for my father and has mistreated my sister and me throughout our childhood. Her goal is to acquire as much as possible and pass it on to her sisters' children. My father wishes to ensure that his wealth benefits his children and not her.

            "Ring-fencing may involve transferring a portion of assets from one high-tax jurisdiction to another with lower or no taxes or less onerous regulations. In other cases, it may be used to keep the money in reserve for a specific purpose. It also may be done to make the money unavailable for another purpose. Instead you can create a private trust. A Trust is a legal arrangement through which the owner of the asset transfers the property to the Trust for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries. The trustee holds the property in representative capacity on behalf of the beneficiaries and not for his personal benefit. A family trust can offer a robust layer of protection for your assets. Still, it's crucial to understand the nuances and conditions under which this protection operates. Family Protection Trusts are often recommended to individuals and families who want to protect their assets from potential future creditors. They are designed to protect the family home from certain creditors, such as care home costs and inheritance tax liability.",

            "Dear Client, To ring-fence your family wealth and ensure smooth succession to your unmarried son and married daughter, you have several legal options, each with its own advantages, such as creating a private trust where you can transfer assets like immovable property, gold jewelry, and cash wealth into the trust. The trust will hold and manage these assets for the benefit of your children. As the settlor, you can appoint trustees (including yourself) to manage the trust assets. You can specify conditions on how and when the assets should be distributed to the beneficiaries. Second is will, A Will is a legal document that specifies how your assets should be distributed after your death. It ensures that your wealth is passed on according to your wishes. You maintain full control over your assets during your lifetime. The Will only takes effect after your death. A Will can specify the distribution of assets, but it does not provide protection against claims during your lifetime, such as those from creditors or family disputes. You can combine a Private Family Trust with a Will. The trust can manage and protect the assets during your lifetime, while the Will can address any assets not covered by the trust. This provides the dual benefit of control and protection during your lifetime, with clear instructions for distribution after your death. Given your goal to protect family wealth from disputes and ensure smooth succession, creating a Private Family Trust appears to be the most robust option, potentially combined with a Will to cover any other assets. Consult a lawyer to help you carry out these legal procedures. Should you require any further clarification please do not hesitate to contact us."

        "full_text": "Death certificate issued after 41 years to grab property. Hello, We own a piece of agricultural land in Tamilnadu. It was bought in year 2000 and we are in complete possession of this land. It's fenced and we are cultivating. Below is the history of this property since year 1980 - 1980 - Person A owner of this property registers a WILL in subregsiter mentioning this property to be given to his wife after this death. - somewhere between 1980 and 1988 this person A passes away and his wife gets the property transferred on to her based on the will. Her 2 children are minor at this stage . - In 1989 wife mortgages the property and clears it in 1994 - In 1995 wife sells the property and her daughter is a major so she has signed as witness. Her son is not major . - between 1995 to 2000 the property changes hands with 4 different parties and we buy it in 2000. Now son of person A has filed an OS stating that the registered will is invalid and forged as his father(person A) died in 1979 and will was executed in 1980. He has submitted a death certificate which is registered and issued in 2023 by the village panchayat and the year of death is mentioned as 1979. However the will is a registered will stamped in subregsiter with the person A's presence in 1981 Below are my questions 1. On what grounds can the VAO register a death and issue death certificate after 42 years of death of a person. I have filed and RTI and awaiting response. 2. Since person A's son was minor during the sale of this property by person A's wife , does he have any grounds? 3. There are 6 different transactions after person A's wife sold it untill we bought it and the son is requesting to cancel all the sale deeds and transfer the property to him. Is there any instance of Tamil Nadu courts issuing such drastic judgements in favor of the Person A Son.",
        "answers": [
            "Minor sin has no share in self acquired property of deceased father bequeathed to mother as per will 2) if testator was present t at sin registrar office in 1981 to register will obviously death certificate is fabricated 3) doubtful that court would grant son any relief after lapse of 42 years",
            "1. VAO is not the competent authority to issue a death certificate. On an application to the Tahsildar to issue a death certificate of the deceased with all supporting documents and reasons for not registering the death at that time, the Tehsildar will issue instructions to the Revenue inspector to enquire the same through VAO and submit a report, after that the Tehsildar will issue a certificate opinion that the death might have taken place during that period which is revealed in the enquiry. Then on that basis the applicant can file an application before the District execution court seeking instruction to direct the concerned registrar of births and deaths to register the death and issue a death certificate as per procedures of law. Any certificate obtained without following the said procedures will be invalid and null and void. As you have applied for information through RTI act, you may wait for it and in the meantime you can challenge the death certificate ion the basis of the procedures as explained above. 2. If this property was A's self acquired property and the same was transferred by a testamentary disposition, then other than the beneficiary of the Will nobody can claim any share in the property as a right. The son of deceased A is doing it with an intention to grab the property or at least to extort huge money from you on the basis of this non maintainable civil dispute, hence you can very well challenge the same on merits and get it dismissed. A has transferred this property by a registered Will and it was properly acted upon by the beneficiary, besides the son remained silent without any challenge up to three years after becoming major hence any act done beyond the limitation period to challenge the Will or making a stake to claim a share in the property after the said limitation period is not maintainable 3. you must wait and watch the proceedings of the case patiently, don't jump into any hasty conclusion about the outcome of the case. .",
            "Dear Client, The Village Administrative Officer (VAO) issuing a death certificate after 42 years is unusual, and the circumstances under which this can happen are quite limited. Generally, delayed registration of death can occur if the death was never registered or if an heir may apply for a delayed death certificate. However, in both the cases proper documentation and verification is required. Under the Indian law there are specific protections for minors. A minor's property cannot be sold without the permission of the court, and any such sale can be challenged later when the minor attains majority. However, since the property was sold by the wife of Person A and the daughter (who was a major) witnessed the sale, the sale might be deemed valid. The son may challenge this sale on the grounds that his interest was not adequately represented during the transaction. But given the time that has passed and the number of transactions that have occurred, this challenge might face significant hurdles. It's quite rare for courts in Tamil Nadu to cancel all sale deeds and transfer the property back to the original owner or their heirs, especially after multiple transactions. However, there have been instances where courts have ruled in favour of original heirs if a fraud in the sale is proven or if the court finds that the wife did not have the authority to sell the property because of the minor's interest. However, the fact that the property has changed hands multiple times and that it was purchased by you in good faith works in your favour. Given the complexity of the case, it would be wise to consult with a property lawyer. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.",

If the Will is genuine, A's wife inherits the legacy to the exclusion of all other legal heirs as the sole legatee. 3. If A's son contests the Will, the legal burden is on him to prove his case to the satisfaction of the court with proper documentary evidence and competent witnesses.

SC held that No one acquires title to the property if he or she was allowed to stay in the premises gratuitously. Even by long possession of years or decades such person would not acquire any right or interest in the said property. it further held that Caretaker, watchman or servant can never acquire interest in the property irrespective of his long possession.

Apex Court also laid fresh guidelines that caretakers, watchman or servants do not acquire any title to a property merely because of its possession by them for several years. Court further observed that Litigation pertaining to valuable real estate properties is dragged on by unscrupulous litigants in the hope that the other party will tire out and ultimately would settle with them by paying a huge amount. which happens because of the enormous delay in adjudication of cases in our courts. If pragmatic approach is adopted, then this problem can be minimised to a large extent. The apex court passed the ruling while upholding an appeal of Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes who was embroiled in a two-decade-long legal battle with her brother and former Member of Parliament Erasmo Jack de Sequeria, whom she had appointed as a caretaker of her property in Goa. 2) The Courts are not justified in protecting the possession of a caretaker, servant or any person who was allowed to live in the premises for some time either as a friend, relative, caretaker or as a servant. 3) . The protection of the Court can only be granted or extended to the person who has valid, subsisting rent agreement, lease agreement or license agreement in his favour. 4) The caretaker or agent holds property of the principal only on behalf of the principal.

So currently it is 54 feet on North and South and 56 feet on East and West. The plot came into corporation limits in 2011.

            "Dear Client, Banks generally cannot deduct amounts from your savings account without your explicit consent or a prior agreement. However, banks can only do that in case of unpaid loans or under suspected fraudulent activity or legal judgments. When you opened your Axis Bank savings account and obtained your credit card, you likely agreed to the terms and conditions that may allow the bank to set off outstanding credit card dues against your savings account balance. If there was no explicit agreement giving Axis Bank the right to deduct amounts directly from your savings account, then they cannot do so without your consent. Since no legal action has been taken by the bank from 2012 till date, the principle of \"limitation period\" might come into play. As per the Limitation Act, 1963, the typical limitation period for debt recovery is 3 years from the date the debt becomes due. Check the terms and conditions of your Axis Bank savings account and the terms associated with your credit card. Clarify the situation and confirm if there were any terms that allowed them to deduct money without your explicit consent. Consult a lawyer if needed.

What are our options to collect such dues as some members have not paid maintenance charges for more than 3 years.",
        "answers": [
            "Only if your society is registered, the model bye-laws are applicable to every resident. Each member is mandated to pay maintenance charges under the law. In an unregistered society or apartment association, members cannot be forced to do so. In most cases, the members are themselves held accountable for fixing any damage or paying for services since there is no managing committee to look after such needs. Thus it has been observed that while in an unregistered society, some members get together, form an Adhoc committee and collect maintenance charges. Some members pay willingly while others refuse to pay up, burdening others with their share of financial responsibility. In the case of a registered society, the Managing Committee can penalise defaulting members and collect the dues as well as interest. Moreover the funds are collected in an individual member's personal bank account hence it will certainly pave way for a big dispute from the non-cooperative members.",
            "The managing committee of the society has the right to act as a mediator or arbitrator with the power to resolve disputes among members. In case of an unregistered society, with no supervising authority, petty or big disputes such as parking slot occupancy, late-night partying, the encroachment of space, etc.persists without a satisfactory resolution. In worst-case scenarios, members facing major problems have the option to approach the police or civil court. But if a society is registered, many problems find solutions with peaceful negotiation and conflict resolution provided by the managing committee. In the case of unregistered societies, members pay heavy amounts out of pocket to fix any broken amenities or if an emergency occurs. This is not a feasible approach to handling financial management in the long run. The prudent and advantageous action would be to register your society at the earliest and receive a complete handover from the builder. Not registering your society can leave you vulnerable to disasters and unforeseeable circumstances.",

            "Dear Client, If the committee or association is not legally registered, it does not have the same legal authority as a registered society. Legally, an unregistered association does not have the statutory power to enforce interest and penalties on defaulters. The collection of dues, interest, or penalties must typically be done through a legally recognized entity with the authority to enforce such payments, like a registered cooperative housing society. Collecting dues in an individual’s personal account can raise concerns regarding transparency and legality. The best legal course of action would be to press the builder to hand over the society registration papers and formalize the maintenance structure under a registered cooperative housing society. Once registered, the society can legally collect dues, charge interest, and impose penalties on defaulters as per its by-laws. In the meantime, you may seek to negotiate with the defaulters, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining the common areas for everyone's benefit. Without formal registration, your ability to enforce penalties or even compel payment is significantly weakened. You may rely on the goodwill and voluntary compliance of members, but this is not a legally enforceable solution. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us."

The legal heirs of Guna are his son Kumar, daughter Meena, and his mother Poon. For Jo, the legal heirs are her son Kumar and daughter Meena. Meena and Jo's jewelry were kept in a bank as collateral for a loan, which was repaid by Meena and Kumar after Jo's death. The repayment money came from the sale of Guna and Jo's property by Meena and Kumar. However, Kumar took possession of all the jewelry and did not share any with Meena, despite obtaining her signature on a regular piece of paper listing the jewelry received, with the date also mentioned. Subsequently, Meena filed a partition suit against her grandmother Poon and her brother Kumar regarding other immovable properties and the jewelry. Now, Kumar is offering to give Meena her jewelry and 50% of Jo's jewelry. He is asking Meena to sign a receipt for the jewelry, including 50% of Jo's jewelry. Meena is concerned about Kumar's reliability, fearing he might take any steps that could disadvantage her.

            "Dear Client, The signature on the regular piece of paper acknowledging the receipt of the jewellery can be legally significant. It might be interpreted as Meena accepting that she has received her share of the jewellery. This could potentially weaken her claim in the ongoing partition suit, as Kumar could argue that Meena has already received her due share and has acknowledged it in writing. Given Meena's concerns about Kumar's reliability and the ongoing court case, it is generally not advisable to sign any documents or accept the jewellery without taking proper precautions. Signing the receipt could be construed as an acknowledgment of settlement outside the court, which might adversely affect her legal standing in the ongoing partition suit. If Meena decides to proceed with signing and receiving the jewellery, she should ask for a receipt specifying the items being received and sign it in the presence of witnesses. If possible, specify that the receipt of the jewellery does not affect the ongoing partition suit or any other legal claims Meena may have. If proper steps are not taken Kumar might claim that the receipt of the jewellery constitutes a full and final settlement by presenting the signed receipt in court. Yes, it is possible that Kumar could claim that a compromise discussion is underway or that a settlement has been reached if Meena signs the receipt. He might request the court to cancel or halt the proceedings based on the alleged settlement. This could complicate Meena's legal standing in the case. Hence, Meena should ideally avoid signing any documents until the court case is resolved. If Meena decides to sign, she must take the safety steps mentioned above to protect her interests. She should explicitly state in the receipt that the acknowledgment of the jewellery does not settle any ongoing disputes or legal claims. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.",

Transfer Without Signature of All Legal Heirs: Generally, the transfer of a deceased person’s vehicle should not be affected without the consent and signatures of all legal heirs, unless there was a valid will or nomination stating otherwise. If no nominee was assigned and no will exists, all legal heirs are required to agree to the transfer. The fact that the car has been transferred without your consent suggests possible fraudulent activity. 2. Obtaining Transfer Records: To challenge the illegal transfer and gather evidence, you should file an RTI (Right to Information) application to the Panchkula RTO. This application should request details of the transfer, including the application form, supporting documents, and signatures involved in the transfer process. Additionally, lodge a formal complaint with the Panchkula RTO, detailing the unauthorised transfer and requesting an investigation into the matter. 3. Civil Action: You can file a civil suit in the appropriate court challenging the transfer and seeking the return of the car to its legal heirs. The court can issue an injunction to prevent further use or transfer of the vehicle until the matter is resolved. This legal route helps to establish the rightful ownership of the vehicle among all legal heirs. 4. Criminal Action: Considering the potential fraud, you can also file a criminal complaint with the local police or magistrate against your elder brother and his daughter. The complaint should allege forgery, fraud, and illegal transfer of property. Provide evidence of the previous fraudulent activities related to your younger brother’s belongings to strengthen your case.

Since you don't have assets or obligations in India, enforcing the order directly on your assets may be challenging for her, but if you did have any assets in India, the court could order their attachment to recover the maintenance amount. However, this may take toll when you decide to travel or engage in business activities in countries that scrutinize your legal history especially India. It is advisable for you to file an application to set aside the ex parte decree if you can show sufficient cause for your non-appearance in court. You may argue that your lawyer’s non-appearance was without your knowledge and that you were unaware of the proceedings. If you believe that your ex-wife has falsified your income, gather and present accurate financial records to the court.

            "Difficult for XYZ to claim adverse possession 2) in family possession of one is regarded as possession of all 3) Possession given to family members is generally considered natural and passively permissive 4) is a well-settled principle that a party claiming adverse possession must prove that his possession is \"nec vi, nec clam, nec precario\", that is, peaceful, open and continuous. b) The possession must be adequate in continuity, in publicity and in extent to show that their possession is adverse to the true owner. c) It must start with a wrongful disposition of the rightful owner and be actual, visible, exclusive, hostile and continued over the statutory period",
            "The possession required must be adequate in continuity, in publicity and in extent to show that it is adverse to the owner. In other words the possession must be actual, visible, exclusive, hostile and continued during the time necessary to create a bar under the statute of limitation. It is a settled law that by pleading adverse possession, a party seeks to defeat the rights of the true owner, and therefore, there is no equity in his favour. After all, the plea is based on continuous wrongful possession for a period of more than 12 years. A plea of adverse possession seeks to defeat the rights of the true owner and the law is not readily accepting of such a case unless a clear and cogent basis has been made out in the pleadings and established in the evidence. Plea of adverse possession is not a pure question of law but a blended one of fact and law. Therefore, a person who claims adverse possession should show: (a) on what date he came into possession, (b) what was the nature of his possession, (c) whether the factum of possession was known to the other party, (d) how long his possession has continued, and (e) his possession was open and undisturbed. A person pleading adverse possession has no equities in his favour. Since he is trying to defeat the rights of the true owner, it is for him to clearly plead and establish all facts necessary to establish his adverse possession.",
            "If xyz had a permissive license of a cultivator and he is cultivating the land till today, then how can he claim any adverse possession! Adverse possession can only be claimed in those cases where the person has absolutely no right whatsoever in the property and despite that he squats on the property under the nose of the true owner and asserts ownership right in himself That is not so in your case However if you can show and prove that A B and C had terminated your license to cultivate their land and despite that you still continued to be in possession of the land and began to assert ownership right in yourself, then you would have a case. However proving it would be a task",
            "- As per Supreme Court Judgment, provisions on adverse possession are made under the Limitation Act, 1963. In case an owner does not stake his claim over his property for 12 years, a squatter can acquire legal rights over the property. The prescribed period in case of for government-owned properties is 30 years. - Further, to claim his ownership, this squatter has to prove that his occupancy of the property has been uninterrupted for the entire period. You cannot break the period into halves. - Further, he will also have to prove that he has been the sole occupant of the property. There cannot be under the provisions of the law multiple claimants. - Further, the squatter will also have to let his intentions known to the owner, with an element of hostility into his action. Starting reconstruction work, for instance, would amount to a squatter's attempt to claim ownership. - Further, as per Supreme Court , It is a settled law that there can be no adverse possession among the members of one family for want of any animus among them over the land belonging to their family. - Hence, adverse possession not applied within family members , whether the land was encroached for a period of 12 years or any long period.",
            "XYZ is described as the cultivator (kashtkaar) and has been managing the land through laborers, indicating actual and exclusive possession. XYZ has been listed as the cultivator for 25 years, which meets the need for continuous possession. Being listed as the kashtkaar over an extended period of time can meet the requirements for open and notorious possession. This is where the familial ties and terms with the owners (A, B, and C) are critical. Hostility implies that XYZ's possession was without the permission of A, B, and C. If XYZ is cultivating the property with their permission, it would not be deemed unfriendly. If A, B, and C allowed XYZ to cultivate the property, even implicitly, then XYZ's possession may not be termed hostile, which is an important aspect of unfavorable possession. XYZ must produce unambiguous evidence that his possession was hostile and without authority. Being designated as a kashtkaar is substantial evidence of possession, although it does not necessarily imply enmity. Even if XYZ fits all of the criteria, asserting adverse possession often requires a judicial declaration. XYZ would have to file a lawsuit for declaration of title based on adverse possession and demonstrate all factors in court."

A condition is imposed where the Court comes to the conclusion that it is necessary for any purpose, including any debt to be satisfied, any other claimants, any dues to statutory authorities etc. 2) There are a stream of cases, where having regard to the fact that the petitioners in testamentary cases where probate/letters of administration were sought in respect of the estate of the deceased, had been exempted from furnishing Surety Bond/Administration Bond on the ground that the will was in favour of the natural heirs and there was no contest to the request for grant of letters of administration/Probate. It was observed that where the petitioners/applicants were natural heirs/sole beneficiary of the deceased, any order directing the said petitioner(s) to stand as an administrator/surety of the estate of the deceased would amount to their/his standing surety for themselves/himself. 3) In a recent decision in the case of Rajesh Sinha and Ors. vs. State in TEST CAS. 84/2011 decided on 06.04.2015, taking note of the judicial precedents on the above aspect, delhi HC Court had dispensed with the requirement of the petitioner therein furnishing the Administration and Surety Bond by observing as below:- \"9. On a conspectus of the above legal position on the requirement of furnishing a surety and Administration Bond, it may be noted that in a majority of decisions, it has been held that where a sole beneficiary/legatee is involved, the requirement of offering an indemnity bond/surety bond is dispensable for the simple reason that it would be an exercise in futility to call upon a sole beneficiary/legatee under a will that has been duly proved, to furnish an Administration Bond/Surety Bond when the estate of the deceased has been bequeathed in favour of the very same person",

            "No cheque can be encashed legally after the death of the account holder. Consent of the legal heirs is irrelevant here. The nominee is a mere trustee and not the sole legatee. The nominee is accountable to all the legal heirs for settlement of their respective shares in accordance with the law of succession.",
            "On death of a customer, the order of the customer comes to an end and only if the banker pays the cheque before notice of death, is it valid. It would thus appear that the death of customer terminates his authority to order payment and operates as a countermand of the outstanding cheque. 2) On the moment of demise of customer, the bank, in terms of its contract, is holding the money not to the order of the deceased customer, but to the order of his nominees or legal representatives. The bank cannot thus act on the order of the deceased customer. The cheque, which has been held to be merely an order, thus, on demise of drawer, ceases to be a cheque\". Therefore, no money can be withdrawn form the account of deceased except under the order of legal representative or nominees.",
            "Your question is that one legal heir withdraw the money from the drawer's account with the consent of other legal heir, however it is not known that on whose name was the cheque favored by the drawer and what is the dispute going on between the legal heirs. If the cheque is dated back to the lifetime of the drawer then it is very much valid even after his/her death within three months from the date of cheque. Therefore there can be no dispute maintainable for withdrawing money prescribed in the cheque post death of the drawer by the drawee. If there's any case filed against you for this, you may challenge the same as per law.",
            "Ideally after death without informing the bank he is dead and without submitting death certi its illegal to withdraw",
            "A nominee is a custodian of funds, not an owner. They must act in the interest of the legal heirs. Since you withdrew the money with the consent of the other two legal heirs, this strengthens your legal standing. Documenting this consent is crucial."

All four children of your grandfather have coparcenary rights in the ancestral property. This means your mother, as a coparcener, has a right to claim her share. And since the property as ancestral, your grandfather had no absolute right to give away the plot to one son without the consent of other coparceners. Your mother can file a suit for partition in the appropriate civil court to claim her share in the ancestral property, including the plot given to one son. Along with the suit for partition, your mother can also seek a declaration that the transaction done by your grandfather in 1953 is void and seek an injunction to prevent further alienation of the property. Provide all necessary documents proving the ancestral nature of the property, such as the title deeds, revenue records, and any other relevant documents. Engage a competent lawyer who specializes in property law to draft and file the suit and represent your mother in court.

To challenge the transaction, your mother can file a partition suit in the relevant civil court, asserting her right to an equal share of the ancestral property. She may need to provide evidence that the property was ancestral and that the transfer of the 1 plot was unjust."

Dear Forum Members, I have a question regarding the use of a trademark and its registration. We have been manufacturing a product under the trademark \"Lactodaily\" since 2018 and have been supplying this product to various government departments as well. However, in 2021, another manufacturer named milktech started selling a product and subsequently applied for and successfully registered the trademark \"Lactodaily\" in their name. We were unaware of this fact and continued marketing our product under the name \"Lactodaily.\" Over the years, we have not received any notice regarding the use of this trademark. Now, the product has become very popular and has a high demand. Recently, milktech issued us a notice stating that we can no longer use the word \"Lactodaily\" as it is a registered trademark owned by them. My question is, as an original manufacturer with proper evidence in the form of purchase orders, supply notes, and tax invoices (from the year 2018), can I file a case against milktech for illegally registering this trademark? Additionally, is it likely that the Indian courts will rule in our favour, or will the judgment favour of milktech? Thank you for your guidance. Best regards, Sanyam Jain",

            "If another company alleges it was using the business name before you, it is necessary for you to prove otherwise. You must be able to show you were using the name before the other company claiming it. The best way to do so is to produce records, product labels, or advertising that predates the other company’s claim. If you are not required to register and if you have not trademarked your business name, you still have rights to it that may be enforceable. Not only that, but the other company’s name does not need to be identical for you to charge infringement. However, you need more than a similarity of the name to win your case. You need to show that both your business and the one sharing your name are sufficiently similar or related that it causes confusion with customers. A potential remedy that could be a win-win for both parties is if you consent to another company using the same name. If you determine that there will be no unfair competition and the other company courteously requests it, you can consent in writing to allow the other business to use the same name or a similar one to yours. A cease-and-desist letter is the first remedy to use if you have not given consent for another business to use your name. It must be carefully worded, so the other business is more willing to comply. Unless you are prepared to take it to court, you should keep the tone neutral and polite. It is possible they were unaware of your company when they began using the name; give them the benefit of the doubt while making it clear you wish them to stop. If two companies are in entirely different industries, they can have the same name. For instance, “Delta” is a trademarked name for both an airline and a faucet manufacturer. Only trademark registration can provide legal rights of exclusive use of a mark under the trademark class it was registered under. Company or LLP registration on the other hand creates a legal entity for undertaking business activities.",

        "full_text": "Transfer of flat property to legal heirs. Respected Sir/Madam, I am writing to address the matter of transferring a flat/property to the legal heirs in accordance with the wishes of my deceased grandparents. My grandparents, who resided in the adjacent building, lived with my late deaf and mute uncle (Central suburb of Mumbai 1 room kitchen flat). Prior to their passing, they had submitted a society nomination form requesting that, upon their demise, the flat be transferred to their deaf and mute (single, unmarried) son (my uncle), myself, and my wife. This decision was based on the care we provided to them after my father passed away due to cancer. Following my both grandparents' death in 2010, we completed all necessary nomination formalities through a lawyer (as instructed by society). We obtained signatures from my two aunts, my sister (the three children of my grandparents), and made a public notice through the newspaper. The society, following these formalities, added our three names (my uncle, myself, and my wife) to the share certificate. Consequently, we received maintenance bills in these three names without any issues. Unfortunately, my deaf and mute uncle passed away in 2023 due to post-COVID complications. Last month, we approached the society to remove my uncle's name from the share certificate, leaving only my and my wife’s names. However, the society committee members are divided in their opinions. Some members believe it is a straightforward transfer since my uncle was unmarried and we were his sole caretakers and closest family members. Others argue that we need to go through the entire legal heir procedure again for my uncle's 33% share of the flat, which would involve my deceased father's siblings and my sister, despite their previous consent through affidavits and a public notice. We seek legal advice on the appropriate steps we and the society committee members should take in this situation. Your guidance would be greatly appreciated. Yours sincerely,",

You and your wife would have to seek NOC from you other aunts and uncles for the transfer and also give a public notice. this has become a procedure followed by most societies. regards,",
            "Property is transferred once in your names with no objections from other legal heirs. The property is in the name of you, wife and uncle after due consent of other legal heirs. Legal heirs by giving their consent have relinquished there rights if any in the property. Said rights cannot be reviewed under any circumstances. What the society has to ascertain now is if there are any legal heirs of deceased uncle apart from you who can claim the property. A public notice in newspaper seeking objections from any possible of uncle should establish your right over the property.",
            "on uncle demise his 33 share would devolve on his legal heirs ie his siblings you need to obtain their consent for transfer of uncle share in your names",
            "The property transferred in the society records will not confer title to the nominees. They can have share certificate on their names only towards the shares of the society but the property shall devolve equally on all the legal heirs of the original owner.Upon intestate death of the original owner, the nominee of the property can only receive the proeprty on behalf of the legal heirs and transfer the same to the legal heirs. The NOC given by the siblings your deaf and mute uncle on a plaint paper cannot be considered as a proper relinquishment of their rights in the property. The newspaper publication is just a public notice and cannot be consider as a legally valid to recognize the relinquishment of their rights. Now as you people are not the legal heirs of either the your uncle nor the legal heirs of your deceased grandfather, you cannot claim any rights or interests over the property especially if the legal heirs of your grandfather are still living. The society is right in their opinion to obtain a release deed or a gift executed in yor favor by the legal heirs to your grandfather. Therefore if you go to the root the original transfer to your names itself is invalid therefore to avoid any litigation in this regard you may better follow the instructions as passed by the society in this regard failing which you may be facing danger of losing the entire property too.",
            "The deceased are Muslims So the Shariat law will apply From your query it seems that they had 4 children ie 2 sons (your late father and uncle) and 2 daughters (your paternal aunts ) As per Shariat the son takes double the share of the daughter Thus after your grandparents demise their flat will go to their children in the following ratios: Son 1 - 33.33% Son 2 - 33.33% Daughter 1 - 16.67% Daughter 2 - 16.67% After your father's demise his 33% would devolve on you and your sister as follows: You - 22.22% Your sister- 11.11% Now your grandparents had made a nomination in favor of your uncle, yourself and your wife It is settled law that a nominee only holds the property in trust for the heirs of the deceased member. The nominee does not get any title over the property unless such nominee is also an heir of the deceased After your grandparents demise, their 4 children were entitled to the flat. One son (your uncle) was a joint nominee with you and your wife. So all 3 of you were holding the flat IN TRUST for the other heirs of your grandparents (your father and 2 aunts), your uncle doubled up as a joint nominee as well as a co-heir Just by entering name in the share certificate the title does not get completed. Ideally an heirship certificate ought to have been obtained for declaring the heirs of the deceased Now your uncle died. So his 33.33% would go to his heirs. As he was unmarried, his share would devolve on his siblings as per Shariat. It appears from your query that your father predeceased your uncle So the uncle's share would go to his 2 sisters. Whether the children of the predeceased brother would get any share from their paternal uncle's estate, I need to check. Will get back. However please note that after your uncle's demise , an heirship certificate should be obtained for declaration of his heirs, so that the title of the persons to whom the property is transferred ultimately , stands completed and there is no issue in future at the time of selling the flat Also the view of few committee members that the procedure of devolution of uncle's share to his heirs, is the correct legal view The view that upon demise of the joint shareholder, the surviving joint shareholders automatically become the exclusive shareholders is not correct. The flat is held by the parties as tenants in common (co owners) and not as 'joint tenants' (where upon death of any joint tenant, the right survives to the surviving joint tenants). There is a difference between the 2 concepts. In a society , the flat , when held by more than 1 person, is held as tenants in common."

The bank had also committed serious due diligence while approving the loan as the builder was long in the bankrupt list and did not have his license in a renewed state during loan approval (the build license is still not renewed). Now, I am planning to sell my property linked to the first loan which is running smoothly. Initially the bank said as there is another NPA we will not be able to transfer the loan to the new owner and I need to pay the remaining amount and close it to get NOC. I did the same and paid Rs 12 Lanks remaining but then the bank said they are unable to close my 1st loan due to their internal issues. They took around 1 month and finally two days back they came back saying they will be able to close the 1st loan but no NOC or bank papers will be provided.

Manali Malik & OrsDecided on 5 May, 2009 Honble High Court of Delhi in IA No. 6459/2008 in CS (OS) No. 930/2007 analyzed this kind of situation and discussed the whole law of negotiable instrument act. The relevant paras are: 10. The relevant provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act relating to a cheque have been perused. Section 6 defines the cheque as a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand. Normally cheques are issued on the banks holding the monies of the drawer of the cheque. The bank is in the position of the debtor of the drawer of the cheque. The cheque is thus an order of the drawer thereof as creditor, to the bank who is his debtor, to pay to the payee of the cheque on the date of presentment the amount thereof. The IA No.6459/2008 in CS(OS) No.930/2007 Page 7 of 14 relationship between the drawer of the cheque and his banker is contractual. 11. Under Section 31, the liability of the bank as drawee of the cheque is, subject to having sufficient funds of the drawer in its hands properly applicable to the payment of such cheque, to pay the cheque when duly required so to do. It is only when the bank defaults in such payment that it becomes personally liable to compensate the drawer for any loss or damage caused by such default. Else, bank as a drawee of the cheque is not liable personally for default in payment thereof. The text book on the Negotiable Instruments Act by Bhashyam & Adiga (17th Edition) under Section 31 thereof states that at the instant of the death Suit No.840/06 6 of the drawer, the title to the balance vests in his legal representative and his own order is not competent to withdraw any part of that which is no longer his property. It is further stated that on death of a customer, the order of the customer comes to an end and only if the banker pays the cheque before notice of death, is it valid. It would thus appear that the death of customer terminates his authority to order payment and operates as a countermand of the outstanding cheque.",

The suit under order 37, thus not maintainable on such cheque. In the above judgment it is also held that \"The said mandate, on demise of customer, ceases to be a mandate. On the moment of demise of customer, the bank, in terms of its contract, is holding the money not to the order of the deceased customer, but to the order of his nominees or legal representatives. The bank cannot thus act on the order of the deceased customer. The cheque, which has been held to be merely an order, thus, on demise of drawer, ceases to be a cheque\".

He did partition the land among the 4 sons before 1991 and 4 sons had a contract with one firm in 1991 for the bulding scheme development. This contract doesn’t contain any end date and contract is also not registered. Nothing happened so far till now on this land. The owner of that firm whom had contract with, was dead in 2008 and his son took over the ownership of that firm. These 4 sons (my father and his 3 brothers) had one more contract in 2015 with another party for building the scheme development and this contract is also not contain any end date and this contract is also not registered one.

First party filed a suite in 2018 and we lost in lower court under article 54 in rule 7 order 11. Court counted the time period from the 2015 to 2018. Court said first party got aware in 2015 when another party published the advertisment in newspaper for title clearance certificate and first party filed the suite in 2018 before completing the 3 years of period. 2.

Now this land is converted from agriculture to non agriculture land. We would like to get out of this all matters and want to sell this land to someone third party.

The title clearance certificate can only be obtained if these disputes are resolved or clarified. Given that both the 1991 and 2015 contracts are unregistered and have no end date, you may need to negotiate with the current parties involved to formally terminate these contracts. This step is crucial to preventing future legal claims. Ensure that all co-owners (your father and his three brothers) are in agreement about selling the land. This collective agreement is essential to proceed with the sale and to avoid any internal disputes. If necessary, file a petition in court seeking a declaratory judgement on the validity and enforceability of the unregistered contracts and to obtain a clear directive on the land's title status. This will help in obtaining a title clearance certificate.",

He later got approval to convert this land into residential layouts registered under Panchayat, and so far the documents have been good. I also found that the big agricultural land that was attached to the above said Kumki land is still in the name of his father. And the sale happens with the consent of his elders.

            "1. Since the Kumki land was granted to the owner by the Tahsildar, one has to look into the lock-in period, if any in the order. 2. If there were to be no lock-in period, then the owner's action of getting the land converted into residentially converted land by the Deputy Commissioner of the District and getting layout's plan sanctioned by the jurisdictional Panchayat will be in order. 3. Even though the big agricultural land that's attached to the Kumki land is still in the name of his father, doesn't affect the independent rights of the owner of the granted land, which was earlier Kumki land. 4. There could be no legal potential risks to be foreseen by the minor kids claiming rights over the layout as this Kumki land grant is to be treated as his self acquired property and the owner of such self acquired property is independent to take any decision regarding such land such as forming layout, gifting the land to a stranger or a relative or to a charitable organisation.",
            "Dear Client, Typically, kumki land refers to land in Karnataka which is assigned for agricultural purposes or grazing and is attached to a patta land. Kumki land itself does not confer ownership rights and is subject to restrictions on transfer and use. The conversion of kumki land to a residential layout must be properly sanctioned by the relevant authorities. Ensure that all necessary permissions were obtained legally, and the conversion is properly documented. Check for any conditions or restrictions attached to the grant or conversion. If the layout land was originally part of ancestral property, minor children might have a claim upon reaching adulthood, asserting their right to a share. While obtaining consent from family elders is a positive step, it is crucial that all legal heirs are part of the consent process. For minors, this usually requires court approval to ensure their interests are protected. Consulting a property lawyer to thoroughly review all documents and potential risks is highly recommended to avoid future disputes.

If you get the relief of registering of paaa and allotment of flat, then you can deposit the registered paaa with the bank so that it can release the payment to the builder, minus the interest This is my prima facie view",

            "The process of society redevelopment involves obtaining consent from a minimum percentage of society members, appointing a developer, preparing a redevelopment agreement, obtaining approvals, demolishing existing structures, and constructing new ones, followed by the handover of redeveloped units to society members t has been often noticed that during the process of redevelopment, the terms of Development Agreements as agreed upon, are later twisted and grossly violated by the Developers and the ground rules of MRTP and DCR by unlawful planning are flouted by constructing additional/unauthorized areas that are beyond the entitlement (i.e. beyond the plot FSI and the TDR/FSI loaded) for their hidden financial gains. RERA provides legal protection to buyers and ensures that developers fulfill their commitments. Timely Delivery: Buyers can expect better adherence to project timelines, minimizing inconveniences. Quality Assurance: Redevelopment projects are held to the same quality standards as new constructions A permanent alternate accommodation agreement (PAAA), which protects the rights and claims of the home-owner, should also be signed before vacating the flat and commencing redevelopment. .However, it appears that this has not happened in your Society. However in the absence of signing the PAAA the demand made by the developer towards the interest over the dues in this regard can be an unjustified claim and not maintainable because the builder is taking the advantage over the flat owners on such fictitious reason. You can proceed legally against the developer You can drag him to consumer grievances rederessal commission for deficiency in service and also for unfair trade practice adopted by the developer."

        "full_text": "Ownership transfer fee demanded by builder for resale. I paid 95% of the flat cost to a builder. We are now going for property registration as my individual apartment structure is complete but the finishings and handover would take another 1 year. Initially, we made a Agreement of Sale 15 years ago (yes, the builder has delayed the project quite a lot). The original copy is missing. In the new Agreement of Sale which we haven’t signed, the builder has put a clause that he will be maintaining the property for 5 years post handover and until that time, if I resell my property I have to pay Rs. 300 per sq ft (total Rs. 6,39,600) as Ownership Transfer Fee to the builder because he is maintaining it. However, this clause was not mentioned in the old Agreement of Sale 15 years ago. (we have a soft copy of old AoS signed by builder but not signed by us) Is this legal? Can I contest in the court of Telangana?",
        "answers": [
            "Clause is not legal .once sale deed is executed you are absolute owner of flat you are not liable any transfer charges you can contest the clause in court",
            "Not legal, neither this clause is valid. You can sell without giving any penny to builder.",
            "This is an unjustified demand and renders it illegal demand. You can strongly object to it and if necessary you can take it up legally by first issuing a legal notice demanding the builder to scrap the newly introduce clause which is against the interests of the buyers and was not informed earlier in the previous agreement to sale and also can mention that there is no necessity to execute a fresh agreement when the previous one was not cancelled on mutual consent.",
            "There is no new executed agreement as it is not signed by you. It is only a proposal by the builder. Any sale of immovable property is absolute transfer, the seller cannot claim any share in the further sale by transferee. After sale the transferer is out of scene. Such clause is not enforceable by the builder, the same being “unfair contract” under Section 2 (46) of new Consumer Protection Act, 2019. Anyway you have not signed the agreement. You can very much file a consumer complaint in District Consumer Commission and seek direction against the builder. Under new Consumer Protection Act, 2019 proceedings are very fast. You need not appear in District Consumer Commission. You will get a direction to the builder, cost of complaint, compensation for mental harassment and lawyer's fee.",
            "Dear Client, The original Agreement of Sale, even if not signed by you but signed by the builder, holds some evidentiary value. Any new terms introduced after such a long delay, particularly those that are financially burdensome and were not part of the original agreement, can be contested. Start by formally communicating your disagreement with the new clause to the builder. Send a legal notice to the builder. You can file a complaint in the Consumer Court under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. The complaint should detail the delay, the original agreement terms, and the new clause's unfair nature. Since this is a real estate matter, you can also file a complaint with the Telangana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). RERA is specifically designed to handle disputes between builders and buyers. It would be advisable to consult a lawyer who can help you draft the necessary legal notices and guide you through the process of filing complaints with the appropriate authorities.

        "full_text": "Legal option about land granted long ago. The land I am planning to buy is in Karnataka, it has all the documents like EC, sale deed copies, survey etc. As per EC the first owner sold land in 1940. In the sale deed it is mentioned as Kushki land granted by government. It was granted to general category person. But there is no document to show the proof of grant or year of grant. - Is it safe to buy this land. Will there be problem in ownership or get loan or DC conversion in future? - The survey number has * (for example 10/*/*). Some are saying * means its gomala land. What is the meaning of *? - I have given token advance and taken receipt on 100 Rs stamp paper without registration. Is it possible to legally file case and get back the amount if seller refuses to return it?",
        "answers": [
            "The kushki land is a dry land belonging to government and mainly used for burial grounds 2) you will have to check terms and conditions of allotment 3) sale of land granted by the government may not allowed for a period of 15 years. 4) contact a local lawyer",
            "The kushki lands will be under the government which will be used for burial ground and any other purpose, hence you have to deal with it accordingly. he land comes under revenue land and not under agricultural land, hence the kushki land is vulnerable for acquisition by government anytime. Since the entire land is revenue land, there is always a danger of acquisition for this kushki land. Also, sale of land granted by the government is not allowed for a period of 15 years. The receipt acknowledging the payment towards advance is a substantial evidence hence it can be used as evidence in case you would be required to file a suit for recovery of your money",
            "Land owned by government is always government land. All subsequent transfers are not binding on government. You will face problem at every stage. You can recover every rupee of advance with interest on the ground that seller does not title to transfer the land.",
            "Dear Client, The term “Kushki land” generally refers to dry or unirrigated land. Since it was granted by the government, ideally, there should be documentation proving the grant, including the year and conditions of the grant. The absence of a document proving the government grant can be a red flag. Gomala lands are grazing lands reserved for cattle by the government. If the land is indeed classified as gomala, it is typically not available for private purchase and may be subject to different regulations. The asterisk in the survey number can indicate several things, such as a sub-division or specific classification of land. Consult with the local land records office to clarify the meaning of the asterisk in the survey number. While an agreement on a ₹100 stamp paper indicates an intention to create a legal obligation, it is not a registered document, which weakens its enforceability. If the seller refuses to return the token advance, you can still file a suit for recovery of the amount based on the receipt as evidence of the transaction. Consulting with legal and property experts can help ensure that the land purchase is safe and legally sound. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.",
            "- Gomala land in Karnataka refers to areas designated as common grazing lands or pastures , and the government primarily assigned these land parcels to rural communities to graze livestock while preserving natural resources. - Further, the government has strict rules and regulations to protect Gomala land from being sold or misused, and any attempt to sell or privatize Gomala land is subject to legal action. - Hence, you may face trouble in future if you will purchase such lands. - You can recover your advance payment from the seller on this ground."

            "Dear Client, Land acquired by the government for a specific public purpose such as, establishing a cement factory is bound by the conditions set at the time of acquisition. If the land is no longer being used for the purpose for which it was acquired, there may be grounds for reclaiming it. In order to reclaim the land we have to check whether the land is genuinely not being used for the cement factory and for how long has it remained unutilized. If it remains unutilized for five years from the date of possession, it shall return to the original owner or their legal heirs. After that, file a petition in the appropriate court or tribunal seeking the return of the land. However, the consideration of the 1.32 acres of land for road given to the factory, complicates the reclamation process.

We have been living on a property for last 32 years as owner and the property was purchased via GPA/Will/ATS/Receipt in 1991. The property is in Delhi, India. It is a residential property. Suddenly a parallel chain of the same property emerged. The last two documents in the chain are registered sale deeds. Noticing this, we have filed a suit for declaration of title and injunction in the district courts. We paid the court fees as follows: Valuation of the suit for the purposes of court fees and jurisdiction as under: A. For Perpetual Injunction Rs. 1,00,00,000/- Court fees paid: Rs 500/- B. For Mandatory Injunction Rs. 1,00,00,000/- Court fees paid: Rs 500/- C. For Declaration Rs. 1,00,00,000/- Court fees paid: Rs 200/- In the last hearing, the magistrate passed the following order: “Perusal of record shows that though the plaintiff seeks the declaration that she be declared as the owner of the suit property, the court fees has not been filed accordingly. The plaintiff is required to file ad valorum court fees on the said relief. Hence, she is directed to do so by the NDOH.” We are in a fix as to how to deal with this order as our advocate is of the opinion that we need not pay ad valorem court fees as we are already in settled possession of the suit property.

            "Typically, ad valorem court fees are required when the plaintiff is not in possession of the property and seeks to gain possession through the declaration of title. However, will need to go through the Plaint and the injunction application to advise further",
            "in order to find out whether the suit is properly valued or not, one has to look into the averments in the plaint, the relief sought for and then decide the provision which is to be invoked for payment of court fee. In this context, it is also necessary to keep in mind Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. The declaration that a particular sale deed is not binding on the plaintiff would become necessary only when a person who has interest in the property, but is not a signatory to the document, and some other person purports to convey the said title. in other cases, whether the subject matter of the suit is capable of valuation or not, fee shall be computed on the amount at which the relief sought is valued in the plaint or on rupees one thousand whichever is higher. That is precisely what Section 31 of the Specific Performance Act provides. Any person against whom a written instrument is void or voidable and who has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him serious injury, may sue to have it adjudged void or voidable. Therefore, only a person who is a party to the instrument is entitled to such relief. Any person against whom the instrument is void/voidable reasonably apprehends that such instrument if left outstanding, it may cause him serious injury, he may bring a suit to get the document annulled. That is precisely what is done by the plaintiff by filing the suit. A clever drafting would not enable the plaintiff to avoid payment of court fee. Instead of seeking possession after cancellation, the relief is sought is by way of mandatory injunction directing the defendant to surrender the schedule property, failing which he would get it through process of court. In other words, after the sale deed is cancelled, the plaintiff wants delivery of possession. Therefore, he ought to have sought for cancellation of the sale deed under Section 31 of the Specific Performance Act, sought for consequential reliefs then the valuation of suit may not be proper."

This can have implications for the legal status of the project and any transactions related to it. Release Order from BIAAPA and Individual Kathas indicate that the local planning authority (BIAAPA) and municipal authorities have recognized the project and its individual plots, which is a positive sign regarding the legitimacy of the development. It is advisable to Confirm with the RERA authority why the project is blocked and if there is any possibility for the developer to resolve this issue. Contact the developer and ensure that the developer resolves the RERA blocking issue, either by extending the project completion date or addressing any other compliance requirements. It is a plus point that you are satisfied with the development and amenities but legal compliance is crucial. Proceeding with registration in a blocked project can result in future legal complications. Hence, before registration make sure that the project status is updated and compliant.

Without an OC, the building is technically considered unauthorized, and there can be significant legal and safety implications. The Building Regularization Scheme (BRS) allows for the regularization of unauthorized constructions by paying certain charges. However, as you mentioned, the BRS matter is pending in the Telangana High Court. This means the legality of the 5th floor and any construction regularized under BRS is uncertain until the court gives a verdict. Buying a flat without an OC means you have limited legal protection if the municipality decides to take action against the unauthorized construction. Also future resale of the property may be difficult, as potential buyers might face the same issues with financing and legal compliance. Proceeding with the purchase without an OC is generally not advisable, especially when reputable institutions like HDFC Bank are refusing loans due to these issues. Consider waiting until there is a clear legal resolution regarding the BRS matter in the High Court or Look for properties that have the necessary legal clearances, including an occupancy certificate.

Even though you are skeptical about approaching the High Court due to the backlog of cases, a writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India can be filed. A writ petition can be filed for the issuance of a writ of mandamus to direct the lower court to expedite the proceedings. Given your circumstances and the undue delay caused by the respondent, the High Court may take a sympathetic view and direct the lower court to expedite the case. Another choice you have is to file an affidavit in the trial court detailing the hardship caused by the delay, including your age, the health condition of your parents, and the undue financial burden due to the interim maintenance. This can sometimes persuade the judge to take more immediate action to expedite the proceedings. If there has been an order for speedy disposal and it is not being adhered to, you might consider filing a contempt petition. This step can be taken to enforce compliance with the court's order for expeditious disposal of the case. In exceptional cases where the judge is seen as biased or overly lenient towards the respondent, you can apply for a transfer of the case to another court.

        "full_text": "Jurisdictional limits of High courts in Regular Second appeal for Civil Suit by Section 100 order xLII Rule1. Respected Sir, Request you to provide some relevant information on the extent of power invested to the High court in the proceedings for a RSA. The substantial question of law formulated on the basis of the appeal has to be framed and heard from both the appellants and the arguments from the respondent as well. Once the formulated question of law has been answered in a justified and favourable manner for the respondent, then the appeal has to be dismissed; otherwise if it is found justifiable and answered in favour to the appellant, then the case can be remanded back to the subordinate court for further acceptance and examination of evidence. Does the high court possess the power to modify and vary appellate court judgement , based on its own discretion, without remanding the case to the lower court; even if the substantial question is answered in favour of the respondent; which calls for the dismissal of appeal by the HC. As per the section 100 and the order xLVII rule 1 code of civil procedure (appeal for appellate decree); can it be considered as an interference outside the legal limits of the High court; if an appeal court judgement is modified likewise by HC; even if the substantial question of law formulated is answered in favour of the respondent and appeal ought to have been dismissed. Does the code of civil procedure in the specified section authorize the HC to modify and vary the appeal court judgement on its own discretion (based on the grounds which are not even a part of the question of law framed or without even a prayer from the appellants side during the previous stages of proceedings); during when the appeal ought to have been dismissed as the question of law is answered in complete support to the respondent in a justified manner. Kindly correct me if I have been mistaken and let me know if the HC is authorized to make such a modification of judgement.",
        "answers": [
            "Appellants cannot be awarded reliefs not prayed for 2) there has to prayer for reliefs claimed 3) HC would consider question of law raised before passing any orders 4) if question of law is decided in favour of Respondents appeal would be dismissed",
            "In the hierarchy of court the order of Division Bench passed in Appeal can only be Reviewed by the same Court on limited grounds like error apparent on the face of the record . For alternation, modification or for setting aside such decision, Supreme Court is the only forum.",
            "The appeal is heard and the court answers the substantial question of law and decides the second appeal accordingly, ie. Either it allows the appeal or dismisses it. It cannot remand the matter back to the district court.",
            "The jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain a Second Appeal is well-known. It is a unique jurisdiction of the High Court where the High Court can entertain a Regular Second Appeal purely on a “substantial” question of law not even a question of law or a question of fact. It is a settled law that the first appellate court is the final Court insofar as the question of facts are concerned and it is only when substantial questions of law would arise in a case that the High Court can entertain a Regular Second Appeal and if at the stage of admission such substantial questions of law are discerned by the High Court the same would have to be framed and the appeal(s) would have to be admitted. It is only thereafter that the parties have to be heard on the substantial questions of law that are framed by the High Court at the stage of admission. 2) However, the CPC gives power to the High Court to frame additional substantial questions of law or to mould the substantial questions of law already framed on hearing the parties at the time of final hearing of a Second Appeal. In the event the respondents before the High Court are on record even at the stage of admission of a Regular Second Appeal and the same is to be disposed of finally even at this stage substantial questions of law must be framed and answered before the Regular Second Appeal is admitted and disposed. 3)If no substantial question of law arose in the case then the appeal could not have been entertained and ought to have been dismissed at the stage of admission 4) HC would modify judgment without specific prayer from Appellant 5) SC IN State Bank of India vs. S.N. Goyal (2008) 8 SCC 9215:has held “15. It is a matter of concern that the scope of second appeals and as also the procedural aspects of second appeals are often ignored by the High Courts. Some of the oft-repeated errors are: (a) Admitting a second appeal when it does not give rise to a substantial question of law. (b) Admitting second appeals without formulating substantial question of law. 8 (c) Admitting second appeals by formulating a standard or mechanical question such as “whether on the facts and circumstances the judgment of the first appellate court calls for interference” as the substantial question of law. (d) Failing to consider and formulate relevant and appropriate substantial question(s) of law involved in the second appeal. (e) Rejecting second appeals on the ground that the case does not involve any substantial question of law, when the case in fact involves substantial questions of law. (f) Reformulating the substantial question of law after the conclusion of the hearing, while preparing the judgment, thereby denying an opportunity to the parties to make submissions on the reformulated substantial question of law. (g) Deciding second appeals by reappreciating evidence and interfering with findings of fact, ignoring the questions of law. These lapses or technical errors lead to injustice and also give rise to avoidable further appeals to this Court and remands by this Court, thereby prolonging the period of litigation. Care should be taken to ensure that the cases not involving substantial questions of law are not entertained, and at the same time ensure that cases involving substantial questions of law are not rejected as not involving substantial questions of law.”",
            "Kindly see S.100(5) The appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated and the respondent shall, at the hearing of the appeal, be allowed to argue that the case does not involve such question: Provided that nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to take away or abridge the power of the Court to hear, for reasons to be recorded, the appeal on any other substantial question of law, not formulated by it, if it is satisfied that the case involves such question. therefore the high court may do it. It has to record reasons obviously. An appeal means that the high court will and can set aside the judgment of the district court. If the appeal is allowed then the judgment of the district court is set aside. That is not over stepping. But all this is hypothetical and therefore you have to share a judgment."

Can a third party move to the court to challenge partition accepted by High Court even after getting the share from the share of the seller. Though the sell purchase was made knowing the fact that partition case in going on. So is this transaction is legal as we got to know that sale made during hearing of a case is a void transaction. 3. Once we won the case of Sec 250 of MPLRC in April 2024 but on very next day when we tried to boundary the opposition threatened us and when we complaint to Tehsildar he said I have no idea who is the real owner and when we tried to file FRI he asked TI not to accept our application and when we again reach out to the Tehsildar he said to file for 250 again so that he can claim illegal possession again and then again we have to go to Tehsildar court then SDM court then Commissioner and this will go on as they will try to repeat it again and again as they have direct support of local revenue authorities.

            "With the death of the proprietor legally the business also ends with him, however the GST law provides a facility whereby the legal heirs can continue the business if they desire so and has provided with a detailed instructions on how such transfer shall take place. In the event of death of the proprietor its legal heirs have an option of either continuing the business or discontinuing. 2)If option exercised by the legal heirs is that they will continue the business of the deceased then the following will be applicable: As per Section 29 the registration of the deceased is still liable to be cancelled. Steps to be taken by the Legal Heirs: – 1. Apply for fresh registration citing reason as Death of Proprietor and Date on which liability arises as Date of death of deceased. 3)2. Section 29 allows legal heirs to file application for cancellation. Therefore, legal heirs will have to get themselves registered as Authorised Signatories in GSTIN of the deceased . 3. To be added as Authorised Signatories Amendment in Registration will not be done by the legal heirs themselves but will have to approach the jurisdictional officer. (Section 28 read with Rule 19 allows only registered person to apply for amendment registration) 4. Legal Heirs will have to prove that they are the legal heirs of the deceased (Legal Heirs are defined in the personnel laws as enforced on the date). 5. Transfer the business 6. Transfer ITC in the credit ledger of the deceased to the new registration by filing ITC-02 7. Apply for cancellation of the registration of deceased within 30 days and file GSTR10 . In CIT v. Madhukant M. Mehta (supra) the case of the assessee was that on the death of sole proprietor the legal heirs forming partnership firm and issue was whether the firm succeeded in the business of sole proprietor, assessee is entitled to carry forward loss of sole proprietor and to set off against the income of the firm. The Gujarat High Court has taken the view as under : \"(i) that the presence of the three factors found by the Income Tax Officer was not necessarily destructive of the integrity or identity of the business so as to negative the idea of succession; (ii) that the facts showed that M had died intestate. Under section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act his property would devolve, firstly, upon the heirs being relatives specified in Class I of the Schedule. Son, daughter and widow are included in Class I. There was a clear recital in the partnership deed that the partners as heirs succeeded to the business of the deceased. The business of the deceased had been carried on even prior to the execution of the partnership deed and the partnership was brought into existence within a very short period after M's death. Having regard to all the circumstances there was succession by inheritance in this case. Merely because M's legal heirs brought into existence a firm and decided to carry on the same business under the firm name, the succession by inheritance was not lost or destroyed. The link or nexus between the business carried on by the deceased and after his death by his heirs previously as a body of heirs and subsequently as a collection of persons joined with each other by the bond of partnership was not lost either in substance or in form and the business, which the firm carried on, still remained the same business which was succeeded to by inheritance by the heirs who were partners. The assessee-firm was entitled to carry forward and set off the speculation losses of M against the income from speculation business earned during the relevant assessment years.\" The view taken by the Gujarat High Court in (1981) 132 ITR 159 (Guj) (supra) has been upheld by the Supreme Court in case of CIT v. Madhukant M. Mehta (2001) 247 ITR 805 (SC).",
            "If a sole proprietor dies, their legal heirs or representatives need to manage the business and handle the legal procedures, such as cancelling the GST registration or transferring the business to their name. In the case of the death of a proprietor, the accounting treatment involves the valuation and recording of assets and liabilities, preparation of final accounts, and distribution of profits/losses among the legal heirs or representatives. In case of the death of a sole proprietor, the business can either be cancelled or transferred to the legal heirs or a new owner. Transfer of business in case of death of a sole proprietor includes obtaining legal certificates, transferring assets and liabilities, and applying for the transfer of ITC. This is because the legal heir will need to apply for a new GST registration in their own name and cannot continue the business in the name of the deceased sole proprietor due to the proprietor having a different PAN. As per Section 29 of the CGST Act, the GST registration will need to be cancelled on the death of a sole proprietor, and the business can be transferred thereafter. They need to apply for the transfer of Input Tax Credit (ITC) by filing Form GST ITC-02 on the GST common portal. As per Section 22 of the CGST Act, they need to apply for a fresh GST registration in Form GST REG-01 using their own PAN as they cannot use the existing registration of the deceased proprietor. Section 18(3) of the CGST Act, 2017 allows the transfer of ITC where the business is being transferred as long as the business’s liabilities are also being transferred in the manner specified in Rule 41. Further, section 93(1) states that if the person liable to pay tax, interest or penalty passes away, the individual who continues the deceased person’s business shall be liable to pay those tax dues.",

The bank is under obligation to transfer the entire amount to the legal heirs either by way of Nominee claim procedure or after getting required winding up documents . 2.

For the sole proprietorship, bank accounts cannot be operated, and you must follow the nominee claim procedure, which results in account closure. However, FDRs maturing in the future and the need for debit facilities complicate matters. You may need to consult with the bank for a possible solution to keep the account active until all financial obligations are settled. For the partnership firm, transferring assets and liabilities from the sole proprietorship to the partnership firm can help. This transfer allows the partnership firm to utilize the work experience and bid capacity of the sole proprietorship for tenders in PWD, RED, Zila Panchayat, etc. Additionally, re-registering bank accounts, GST, PAN, and other documents under your mother’s name ensures she can manage tax filings and receive payments for completed or in-progress works.

Ensure all documents and evidence proving your ownership and the illegal occupation are well-documented and presented. Request the police for immediate eviction of the illegal occupants. In some cases, the court can grant a temporary injunction to prevent the occupier from staying in the property during the trial. Any threats from the trespasser should be reported to the police immediately, which could lead to additional charges against them.

        "full_text": "Saleability of property ignoring typo Error in GPA document registered 22 years earlier. This is about a harmless typographical error made into a GPA document registered 22 years ago in TN. The Plot is part of layout of 18 plots owned by a Person, which was later inherited by his 6 children and 16 grand children. These 5 siblings (also as guardians to their minor children) executed a GPA in favour of the 6th youngest brother in 2002. The GPA agent sold one of the plot (Plot no.15) to my Seller in 2004 and my Seller sold it to me in 2006. I took home loan from SBI, got a building sanction and constructed house, in which I am staying peacefully for the last 18 years. When I wanted to sell my house, a typo error was found in the GPA in 2002 which remained unnoticed till now is holding up the sale. The defect is that Plot No. 15 is typed as 19 in GPA. Rest all dimensions, size etc which are unique in 18 plots, matches perfectly with plot no. 15. When we approached Sub-registrar, we were told to execute a correction deed. But it is impossible to trace 22 heirs after 22 years. Second option was to se a court intervention which takes years. On direction of a legal expert, I executed an Affidavit assuring/ indemnifying the future buyer of any future litigation. I have all original titles with me. All revenue records like Patta, FMB Sketch, A registry extract, VAO/ RI certificates mentions my name as owner. Licenced Construction plan and utility bills from 2006 shows my name. I have been paying taxes for last 18 years. I have EC for the last 50 years with NIL encumbrance. I list following reasons to justify the minor nature of the typo which could be ignored. It is a 18-plot layout there is no plot no.19 in the approved layout. There is NO plot no. 19 in Govt’s FMB sketch, or in EC record of last 50 years or in RI/ Surveyor report. Therefore, Plot No. 19 in GPA actually implies/ indicates one of the other 18 plots in the approved layout. Whereas, the dimensions, sizes and other boundary details match ONLY with plot no. 15 (by 100%). In a hypothetical scenario, I have been leading, open and uninterrupted living for the last 18 years, which is more than the time limit (12 years) for claiming ownership under adverse possession law. Even in a hypothetical sense, even if Plot no. 15 is not mine, I am still eligible to claim ownership, by virtue of my uninterrupted living for last 18 years. Whereas I have all original title deeds, revenue and land records, which unequivocally establishes my ownership. My question is whether my property title is saleable and marketable with my self-declared Notorised Affidavit without going through an impossible task of Rectification Deed or grueling Court intervention exercise. Can a buyer safely ignore this typo error on the basis of my self-declaration in a Notarised Affidavit, as ignored in the past by my seller, GPA Agent, sub-registrar, my lawyer, my bank etc,? The property is a premium one, selling at a very competitive price (70% of market value) and having bee line of buyers, but they dragging foot",
        "answers": [
            "This is not a minor error and change of plot number is a grave error changing the property itself. The notarized affidavit will not solve the problem. It is as good as the same erroneous sale deed. Your assurance by an affidavit is not maintainable in law. As a matter of fact you are not the first buyer. Your vendor only has to undertake the responsibility to get a registered rectification deed rectifying the error and not you. Alternately you can find relief only through court even though it may take little time to overcome the problem.",
            "1. If the 2004 sale deed/GPA in favour of your seller has the correct plot number 15 and if he has executed GPA /sale deed in your favour as plot number 19 by mistake, even though all other revenue records mentions your name as owner, then proceed to execute a registered Declaratory Deed in the jurisdictional Sub Registrar's Office declaring the circumstances in the deed. 2. Subsequent to your following the above procedure, the defect in the title could be set right and you may get a prospective buyer.",
            "You don’t have clear and marketable title to property as GPA mentions plot no 19 has been sold 2) mere affidavit dues not confer title 3) deed of rectification has to be executed to confer title to property",
            "- A plot of land is that part of a cadastral area that is defined by a plot number in the cadastral, and the registration record in the registrar office is always indicated by the plot number. - Hence, if the plot number is having an error then it must be corrected by the execution of a Rectification Deed - Further, if the transferor is not traceless then there must be a direction from the court to correct the same, and an affidavit is not enough.",
            "Dear Client, The error (Plot No. 15 typed as 19) needs to be addressed to ensure clear and marketable title. While your notarized affidavit provides some assurance, it might not fully satisfy legal requirements or alleviate buyer concerns. Despite the typo, the surrounding context (dimensions, boundaries, absence of Plot 19) clearly indicates that Plot 15 was intended. This is a common issue and usually can be rectified via a correction deed. However, the difficulty in tracing all heirs makes this challenging. Though tracing all heirs is difficult, it remains the most legally robust solution. Alternatively, you might be able to publish notices in newspapers and seek a court declaration for correction, simplifying the heir tracing process. For a clear title, especially for financing, legal formalities should be ideally corrected. Your uninterrupted possession for over 12 years strengthens your claim under adverse possession. While time-consuming, a declaratory suit can provide legal clarity. This would make your title indisputable, easing buyer concerns and facilitating financing. Consult with a property lawyer to explore efficient legal avenues for a correction deed or declaratory judgment. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us."

GIDC Lease Transfer Fee Dispute Subject: Challenge to GIDC's Lease Transfer Fee Calculation for our residential plot, Background: I entered into a 99 year lease agreement with GIDC for a residential plot located in GIDC residential area- District Valsad, Gujarat, in year 2004. In the year 2024, We found a buyer for the property and applied for property transfer at GIDC office. The lease agreement/transfer policy states a 5% transfer fee for properties under lease for over 10 years. The plot was subsequently mortgaged to Religare Finvest Ltd in 2016. They later transferred it to India Resurgent Fund ARC in 2019 due to financial difficulties. I was not informed about this internal transaction. After paying India Resurgent Fund ARC in full and obtaining property documents, I approached GIDC for a transfer to a third party. Dispute: GIDC calculated the transfer fee based on the 2019 transaction between Religare and ARC, and thus charging me 25% transfer fee as per their policy for holdings under 10 years. I argue that this internal financial transaction doesn't constitute a change in ownership or lease. The relevant period for calculating the fee should be from my original lease date (2004), qualifying for the 5% fee. I request your assistance in challenging GIDC's decision and urging them to: Recalculate the transfer fee based on the 2004 lease date (5% fee). Please advise on the validity of my claims and the best course of action. & suggest if any previous such cases were fought. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Anuj Baid",

Now you are actually transferring the leasehold rights to the new buyer for equal number of years if not more, therefore the rule of charging 5% towards the transfer fee is the only law applicable hence the arbitral rule now made by the GIDC can be challenged in the high court by filing a writ petition. First you issue a legal notice denying the payment demanded by them after which you can approach high court with the suggested writ.",
            "Dear Client, Your dispute with GIDC over the lease transfer fee is based on the interpretation of the lease transfer policy. You argue that the fee should be calculated from the original 2004 lease date, qualifying for a 5% transfer fee, as the internal financial transactions with Religare Finvest Ltd. and India Resurgent Fund ARC do not constitute a change in ownership. These transactions were for mortgage management and should not affect the lease's tenure. To challenge GIDC's decision, gather all relevant documents, including the original lease agreement and mortgage documents. Highlight that the leaseholder has remained the same since 2004 and submit a formal request to GIDC for a recalculation based on the original lease date. Engage a property lawyer to draft a legal notice if GIDC does not respond favourably. You may also consider filing a complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission or the relevant regulatory authority. Research previous similar cases to strengthen your position. Your argument for the 5% fee based on the 2004 lease date is valid.",

        "full_text": "Builders and its maintenance not allowing tenants since 4 years despite all flat dues cleared in 2018. A flat in Greater Noida West was booked in 2012, with possession taken in June 2018. The registry was completed in June 2018, and all purchase-related dues were cleared by March 2018. Two companies are involved: Company A, the builder, and Company B, the maintenance company. Although both companies belong to the same business family, they are separate legal entities. The builder and maintenance agency are denying tenants access over unpaid club usage charges, despite no actual usage. Remarkably, these services are non-essential, and payments cannot be enforced when there has been no utilization. Ironically, they are also demanding backdated payments, even during the COVID-19 period when CrPC 144 and the Disaster Management Act were in effect. The UP Apartment and Maintenance Act and the Tripartite Deed guarantee a 90-year exclusive and non-expiring ownership lease. The Revised Consumer Protection Act of 2019 clearly defines and prohibits restrictive trade practices, unfair trade practices, and contracts, preventing the imposition of such charges without usage. After escalating complaints to the Chief Minister's Office, GNIDA has issued a notice under the Disaster Management Act. The full Payments details regarding maintenance are given here = https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NwKaHaq7V2vV0ihOfXUMCQmgiA6BTnOaMPFVZzT7AOE/edit?usp=sharing In July 2022, I submitted documents including an allotment letter, flat registry deed, power of attorney (as the flat is registered in my parents' name), and a maintenance agreement to the district magistrate. The magistrate acknowledged that all dues related to the flat purchase had been resolved and tenants could not be prevented from entering the apartments. The Magistrates Office even tried contacting the facility in charge of Company B to inquire about the harassment faced by middle-class individuals in subletting, but received no response. The magistrate forwarded the complaint to the commissionerate, but the FIR was downplayed, citing that the complaint did not come directly from the original owner of the flat but from his son, despite the fact that the owner's son has given full POA to the office of District Magistrate. To date, no tenant form has been provided. I've heard from other flat owners about various harassments during tenant admission, including a ₹1500 entry fee and pressure to submit rent agreements. Despite UP adopting the Model Tenancy Act, issues persist. The Rent Authority, led by a Deputy Collector, regulates rentals and protects landlords' and tenants' interests. Subletting matters are between the owner and tenant, with police handling verification. However, the maintenance agency has overstepped its role, causing issues.I wrote to the District Magistrate in January 2024, and it was forwarded to the ADM (Executive) for action, but I don't know the outcome.

It can address unfair trade practices and harassment issues and can offer remedies, including monetary damages. District Magistrate Follow-Up: As you reported your grievance to the District Magistrate, who has forwarded the same to the ADM (Executive), follow up your complaint with the Office of the ADM and insistently enquire about the action taken on their part. Provide them with copies of any related papers and materials, including the previous communication and decisions made. Police Involvement: In case of further aggravation, then visit the local police station with a complaint along with Documentary evidence along the directives of the District Magistrtate’s office and the show cause notice issued under Disaster Management Act. Defend the FIR by having the proof for harassment and denial of access. Model Tenancy Act: To ensure tenure security of tenants, avail the provisions of the Model Tenancy Act, implemented by UP. Home; Ontario Provincial Complaints; Provincial Complaints Ontario; File a complaint with the Rent Authority of the Deputy Collector citing the specific problem and demanding action to protect the rights of tenants without excessive harassment.

This is a matter of negotiation between the tenant and the landlord. If you find the increase to be excessive, you can negotiate for a lower amount or seek legal advice to ensure the demand is reasonable. 2) Concerning the AC units, there is no specific rule on how many years a landlord must replace appliances like ACs. Typically, the replacement would depend on the condition and functionality of the units. Since the ACs are 8 years old and not cooling effectively, you can negotiate with the landlord for their repair or replacement. If the landlord refuses, you may have to consider whether to accept this condition or look for other accommodations.",

Deposit can be only at the time of renting the property and not on every renewal - He cannot increase the deposit in the renewal legally. 2. If the facility of AC is a part of tenancy, then the tenant has right to repair the same and to deduct the expenditure from the rent. - If denied to change the AC , then you can refuse to pay the increase rent amount.",

The property, purchased in 2014, is part of a building constructed in 2012. Unfortunately, the building has significantly deteriorated due to the use of substandard construction materials by the builder, putting it at imminent risk of collapse, especially during the current monsoon season. The building comprises 40 flats, of which 65% have been sold to customers while the remaining flats are still held by the builder and rented out. Concerned about the safety and structural integrity of the building, we, along with other residents, filed a legal case against the builder, demanding either repairs or financial compensation to cover the necessary repairs. Regrettably, after a prolonged legal battle lasting four years, we lost the case. Presently, the Surat Municipality is actively identifying buildings at risk of collapse and has indicated that such structures will be demolished to ensure public safety. If our building is identified and subsequently demolished, we stand to lose our property without any compensation. Furthermore, our property insurance does not cover demolition or collapse of the building unless it is caused by natural calamities. Given the dire circumstances, we are at risk of losing our property and investment. We urgently seek your guidance on the following matters: 1. Possible legal recourse to hold the builder accountable for the substandard construction and resultant structural degradation. 2. Steps we can take to potentially overturn the previous court decision or to pursue new legal avenues for compensation. 3. Legal protections or remedies available to us if the Surat Municipality decides to demolish the building. 4. Advice on any immediate actions we can undertake to safeguard our property and rights.

        "answers": [
            "Adoption is not permitted in the personal laws of Muslims in India, and hence they usually go for guardianship of a child through the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. In short, Islam does not recognize adoption. Muslim couple can adopt a child from another muslim couples who must be the natural parents of the child to be given under adoption. If muslim couple wants to adopt a child from an orphanage, then Islam does not permit to do so Adoption is a subject matter of personal law since it is a legal affiliation of a child. Similar to Muslims and Parsis, Christians also can adopt a child from an orphanage with the permission of the concerned court under the Guardian and Ward Act, 1980. Under the Act, a Christian can only take a child for foster care. In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that any person can adopt a child under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000 irrespective of religion he or she follows and even if the personal laws of the particular religion does not permit The JJ Act 2000 is a secular law enabling any person, irrespective of the religion he professes, to take a child in adoption. It is akin to the Special Marriage Act 1954, which enables any person living in India to get married under that Act, irrespective of the religion he follows. Personal beliefs and faiths, though must be honoured, cannot dictate the operation of the provisions of an enabling statute, Till now Muslims, Christians, Jews and those from the Parsi community only had the power of guardianship in which one possess only legal right on the child till he or she turns an adult. The biological parents have a right to intervene during that period. Therefore you can consult an experienced lawyer in Pune and proceed with the proposed adoption asthe provisions of JJ act",
            "There is no concept of adoption among Muslims your husband cannot adopt your son",
            "Dear Client, 1. The process for adoption in India involves filing a petition in the court where the adoptive parents reside. An Adoption Deed is a legal document that can be drafted to formalize the adoption, but it must be approved by the court to be legally binding. 2. Since you live in the UAE and the biological father is in Pune, you may need to coordinate with an advocate in Pune to handle the legal proceedings. Both biological and adoptive parents must provide consent for the adoption. 3. The adoption process duration can vary, but it typically takes several months. The court will review the case to ensure that the adoption is in the best interest of the child. 4. To find an advocate in Pune, you can search online legal directories or seek recommendations from legal associations. Look for an advocate experienced in family law and adoption cases. 5. The religious difference may complicate the process, but since you have full custody and the biological father agrees, it should be manageable. Ensure the advocate is aware of these details to address any legal nuances. 6. An Adoption Deed, once legally recognized, can help in updating your son's passport to include his stepfather's name. The deed should be presented to the passport authorities along with the necessary court orders and documents.",

All these constitute acts of mental cruelty. Therefore you can decide about filing a contested divorce case on the grounds of cruelty irrespective of the repercussions because it clearly appears that you may not be able to continue with the marital life in the given situation. You cannot ask for custody of the adult child who is aged 20 years but of course you can think about seeking for custody of the younger child which would become an adult within two years.

Document all instances of her abusive behavior and threats, as well as any efforts you made to reconcile or seek counseling. This evidence will support your case in court. Since marital rape is a serious accusation, be prepared to provide evidence or witnesses that can refute her claims. Regarding joint custody of your children, you can file a petition for joint custody during the divorce proceedings. Courts generally consider the best interests of the children when determining custody arrangements. Highlight your active role in their upbringing and your capability to provide for their welfare despite your financial difficulties. The court will evaluate both parents' ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment. Consult with a family law attorney to guide you through the legal process and to ensure your rights and interests are protected."

            "Dear Client, Based on Section 69(1) of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, your advocate's technical point challenges the jurisdiction and maintainability of the suit filed by your sister. This section stipulates that no suit to enforce a right arising from a contract or conferred by this Act shall be instituted in any court by or on behalf of any person suing as a partner in a firm against the firm or any person alleged to be or to have been a partner in the firm unless the firm is registered and the person suing is or has been shown in the Register of Firms as a partner in the firm. Essentially, for a suit to be maintainable, the firm must be registered, and the suing party must be recognised as a partner in the firm's register. Here are some relevant judgements and citations that might support your case: 1. Raptakos Brett & Co. Ltd. vs Ganesh Property (1998) 7 SCC 184: The Supreme Court held that an unregistered firm or its partners cannot enforce a right arising from a contract unless the firm is registered. This judgement reinforces the necessity of firm registration for maintaining such suits. 2. S V Chandra Pandian vs S V Sivalinga Nadar (1993) 1 SCC 589: This case emphasised that the bar under Section 69(1) of the Partnership Act applies to suits for enforcement of rights arising from contracts or conferred by the Act. 3. Shreeram Finance Corporation vs Yasin Khan (1989) 3 SCC 476: The Supreme Court in this case ruled that an unregistered partnership firm cannot file a suit to enforce contractual rights. This judgement underlines the importance of firm registration in maintaining a suit. In light of these judgments, your advocate's argument based on Section 69(1) appears legally sound. It implies that if your sister is claiming a share in the proprietorship firm using a fabricated MOU and the firm is not registered, or she is not listed as a partner in the firm's register, the suit should not be maintainable. You should present these citations and arguments before the court to contest the jurisdiction and maintainability of the suit effectively. Consulting with your advocate to ensure that these points are adequately argued and substantiated with relevant legal precedents will strengthen your case.",

            "builder is bound to provide amenities mentioned in tender duly accepted by him 2) you can draw attention of members that invite has been sent to only limited builders . further applications should be invited from other builders before decision is taken",
            "Dear Client, 1. As a party to the tender, if you felt that the process was fraudulent, then there are several things you can do legally. First, you may approach the Registrar of Cooperative Societies with a complaint focusing on the differences between the tender that was made available to you and the one published. Besides, you can write to the managing committee via a legal notice and demand that they explain why these irregularities exist and come clean over them. Another course of action is to approach the court and seek a legal remedy in the form of bringing an action against the society and the managing committee for fraud and misrepresentation. Another thing you can demand is a temporary stop to redeveloping by the court until the problem is solved. 2. As for your chosen developers, you can legally do something in this case. One can still add this problem to the list of concerns for the Registrar of Cooperative Societies and point out that the identified tendering process is not transparent and might be biassed. You can also state this matter in the legal notice you served them regarding their failure to invite your recommended developers. Also, you may request a court to extend the tender process to the developers you recommended, particularly if you can prove the unfairness of the selection process. 3. Tenders often come with specific written specifications, and where the tender has stipulated specific amenities and can legally offer them or there is no legal bar to the builder offering them, then legal obligations compel the builder to offer these amenities. In this situation, if the builder is reluctant to provide these amenities, you may approach the Consumer Forum by stating that the builder has committed a deficiency in service. You may also sue to have the terms of the tender complied with or apply to the court for a specific performance order to compel the builder to tender in accordance with the set-down requirements.",
            "1. Has the decision about the tender process been recorded? 2. If yes, you can simply lodge your objection to the Society under copy to the Registrar seeking correction in the process. 3. In case it is not corrected, you can file a Dispute Case before the Registrar of Societies.",
            "If the conditions in the tender are not followed by the developer or if the society is in hand and gloves with the developer favoring the developer then you may bring the lacuna to the notice of the society in writing by sending a letter of protest in this regard stating that such deviations or illegal acts should not be encouraged especially if it violates the PMC conditions for providing the amenities. If the society ignores the genuine reasons stated by you and decides to proceed as per their plan you an approach the registrar with a similar complaint and request for intervention or approach the cooperative court with an injunction petition seeking to restrain the society from granting permission to this developer without inviting tenders from various other developers offering a better scheme for the redevelopment. This developer is bound to abide by the rules and conditions as set out by PMC or BMC",
            "- As per law, Society by law and resolutions must be limited to the mandate of governing the society’s affairs and nothing more. - Further, every resolution of a housing co-operative Society shall be passed at its general meeting by a majority of total members with right of/vote or two-thirds of members present and voting whichever is less. - Further, as per rules of redevelopment of society, the managing committee should convene a special meeting of the members to discuss the redevelopment project. - Further, the bye-laws state that 75% of the total number of members should be in agreement with the redevelopment project before it can be officially undertaken. 1. If the society has not followed the rules and not taken consent from 1/3rd members , then you can challenge the decision , and can lodge a complaint before the management and if no positive responses then approach the registrar. 2. Reply No.1 3. Yes, the builder is bound to provide all the amenities before handing over the possession , and if violate then a complaint can be filed against the said builder."

        "full_text": "What to do if my lawyer does not cooperate fully?. I registered a PCR under section 200 crpc with a sessions court on 26th June 2024 as the offences were serious involving punishment >7yrs as well as PMLA offences . In the prayer I had mentioned BNS offence 111(2)(3) organised crime as one of tge offences for taking cognizance which is not there in IPC. The judge reviewed my petition and asked my advocate to remove the BNS offence as BNS was yet to come in on July 1st. My advocate removed it with a whitener in the prayer on 26th June 2024 itself and resubmitted it and it was accepted. Now, the judge has reserved his order for taking cognizance to 5th july 2024. He wanted 10 days time as FIR was already registered 4 months back in the case and he wanted to ask for police to submit report of investigations. Between 1st & 5th july now, I wanted to file a Interlocutory application through a memorandum seeking leave to modify the prayer and include in the prayer the above deleted BNS offence as BNS will come in on 1st july, along with certain other left over IPC offences mentioned as corresponding offences. 1. Can I file a IA for revision of prayer in the name of Memorandum seeking leave for amendment of prayer? 2. My lawyer is hesitating because he says the judge may get angry that we are delaying the issuing of orders on 5th july 2024 by filing IAs. 3. He also says such IAs are filed only in civil cases to delay progress of the case. 4. He says you can get another lawyer to present & argue for this IA and he will sign the petition but not argue himself in front of the judge. Is this practically possible?",
        "answers": [
            "1. The proposed amendment will not be legally valid as on date hence your application filed if any will not be entertained by court. 2. Your lawyer is correct that the court will unnecessarily pass strictures on the advocate for this 3. In criminal cases it is a criminal miscellaneous petition and not an IA. 4. You can decide about changing the lawyer by obtaining NOC from him",
            "You are at liberty to engage another lawyer ask your existing lawyer to give his NOC 3) your lawyer is right . You are delaying passing of order by the judge",
            "Dear Client, 1. Yes, depending on the circumstances of the case and your legal advice, you can file an interlocutory application (IA) for the revision of prayer, and the memorandum is filed for leave to amend the prayer. This would be a formal motion to the court to declin the BNS offence, as it is now a valid offence as of July 1. It should also explain the reasons for the proposed amendment and give good justification for why the BNS offence is relevant in this case. 2. It is right for your lawyer to worry that such an application may be perceived by the judge as a ploy to drag the process along since IAs are normally filed shortly before a decision is to be made. Nevertheless, if the kinds of change involved in the amendment are important for the case and the cardinal character of the charges imposed, as well as possible outcomes, the risk is justified. The amendment needs to be presented accurately in terms of the urgent need for change and its obvious applicability in the IA discussed; now we can only try to eliminate any foreseeably negative impressions. 3. However, as mentioned above, IAs are generally used in civil matters, although they may be utilised in criminal matters under certain circumstances, including new information or developments in the law that can influence the criminal case. The picture is that the amendment can only be given to IA if its need is proved, and justice will be served in this case. 4. Yes, it is definitely feasible for there to be another lawyer appearing and arguing the IA when the current lawyer continues to operate in all other matters. This may be a good idea in a situation where the current lawyer seems a bit uneasy or thinks that they are not as persuasive as the other side. However, this should be carried out in a well-coordinated manner in order to ensure that the new lawyer is brought to par with the case facts and the reason for the IA, among other factors with regard to the legal strategies and tactics to be taken.",
            "1. Since, the matter is pending for police investigation report , then at this stage you cannot move any application 2. He is correct 3. It can be filed in this case as well, but not at this stage when the matter is fixed for report. 4. You can engage another lawyer , if not satisfied with him",
            "As per my personal opinion, the Judge will not take cognizance of any offence which is mentioned as an offence in the BNS as it is committed before implementation of BNS and at the point of its commission the said offence was not an offence in the old law i.e., IPC. [ * The new law will not apply to the offences taking place when IPC is in force] The reason being that is the new laws will apply prospectively and not restropectively. So the offences committed before implementation of new law will be dealt by the law enforceable at that time and the offences committed after the implementation of new laws will be dealt by the new laws."

Documentation Review: Ensure you collect all the documentation, including the bill entry, receipt of payment for GST, communication with the logistics company, and voicemail from the port authority. Make sure that the adoption plan includes the timeline of events as well as compliance with the following document. 2. Legal Notice: Write a legal notice to the logistics company and port authorities, raising awareness about how their duties were not met, which leads to unjust imprisonment and demurrage fees. This means that you can demand a refund of these charges while presenting proof that you conducted the actions as and when expected or that the delays were not your fault. 3. Engage Legal Counsel: Act swiftly and seek the legal advice of a maritime or logistics attorney with specific knowledge of port operations and relevant legal conflicts. Convey your timetable, the submitted papers, and the legal notice to them for their consideration. They can advise you on the best legal recourse, and should you require it, they can defend and RT you. 4. Formal Complaint: In case the legal notice does not elicit a favourable response from the receiver, seek to escalate the matter by lodging a complaint with the regulatory agencies in charge of ports and logistics service providers, as likely indicated by the Directorate General of Shipping or Customs Authority. 5. Mediation or Arbitration: Present the concepts of mediation and/or arbitration as forms of more severe conflict resolution. These tend to be faster and less confrontational than those and proceedings in court. 6. Legal Action: In the worst-case scenario, it is advised to launch a lawsuit against the culprit persons for the recovery of the undue detention and demurrage fees based on facts like breach of contract and negligence.

Site no. 51 is vacant site Site no. 52 is again Building 51 & 52 had some issues pertaining to grabbing land, hence site 51 went to court & it was in court since quiet some time like 5 or more so, now BBMP has issued notice for both owners of Site 50 [Ours] & site no. 52 asking for our Sale Deed copy as per COURT instructions [ we are not sure of like what’s the case going on or we dont know the exact dimension of site no. 52 / 51 either ] [Site no. 51 is a vacant site comes in between Site no. 50 [Ours] & Site no. 52.] Now based on the notice from BBMP we have send a copy of our Sale Deed to BBMP OfFice, now my query is as follows > As our construction deviated or consumed 1.5 feet extra, what are the consequences [again we are not sure this extra is consumed from site no. 51 or site no. 49 which are our adjacent properties ] ? > Can BBMP demolish our building which is constructed extra ? > what is Court Stance in such cases > Is there any precautionary measure I can take on this ??

            "Dear Client, 1. If your construction went overboard by an extra 1.5 feet, it can have different consequences. If the extra space was taken from site no. 51 or site no. 49, it means you've encroached on someone else's property. This can lead to legal issues, like potential disputes with the neighbouring property owners and possible penalties imposed by BBMP. 2. Yes, BBMP has the authority to order the demolition of any unauthorised construction or encroachment. If it's determined that the additional 1.5 feet were illegally added, BBMP may send you a notice to remove the encroachment. That could involve tearing down the encroached part. 3. In such cases, the court usually orders the property to be restored to its original boundaries according to the legal records. If the court finds that there has been an encroachment, it can order you to clear the encroached area and modify or demolish the structure to comply with the legal property boundaries. 4. As a precaution, it's a good idea to hire a legal professional who can represent your interests and negotiate with BBMP and the court. Get a detailed survey done on your property to figure out the exact extent of the encroachment. If the encroachment is confirmed, you might have to vacate the encroached portion, which could mean partially tearing down the building. 5. It's not clear why site no. 51 didn't check the dimensions when purchasing. It could be due to oversight or not verifying properly. In your case, it was definitely a mistake to not verify the exact dimensions before buying. To avoid such problems in the future, always conduct a thorough survey and verify the property boundaries against official records before finalising any purchase."

A married person Ganesh's Hindu family from Tamilnadu passed away in 1989 with out any WILL and he had a wife and 2 kids at the time Ganesh passed away. A legal heir certificate was obtained in 1989 for Ganesh. In the legal heir certificate, legal heirs are wife, 2 kids, father (Durai) and mother (Poon). So, a total of 5 legal heirs. Ganesh has a property. In 2009, Got patta's name was transferred to all legal heirs including the Ganes’s father Durai. In 2009, they gave a lease agreement to Indian Oil Corp to step up a petrol Pump on the above-mentioned property and the same was registered in the register office for 14 Years. In that lease deed, Ganesh’s father Durai also signed as one of the lessors. Durai passed away in the year of 2019 without WILL. In 2024, Ganesh's mother (poon) is still alive and gave a release deed to Ganesh's son mentioning that Durai passed away so, the property owners become only 4 (Ganesh's wife, 2 Sons and Mother(Poon) and her ¼ share will be released to Ganesh son. The property is not yet divided. My Questions: 1. Even though Durai got a share of property from his pre-deceased son, As Patta's name was transferred to Durai's name and in the 2009 lease deed Durai signed as one of the lessors, I hope, the share of property became Durai's self-earning property. If So, the Durai property dissolves into Durai legal heirs. Am I right? 2. If point 1 is valid, the mother (poon) share become 1/5. In that case, the released deed will not be valid / cancelled due to wrongly mentioning the share ¼ share. Am I right? 3. My Confusion is Father is NOT a class I legal heir, then How come Durai became the legal heir of the Ganesh and even Patta's name was transferred along with Durai and other legal heirs? Even the lease deed was done and Durai signed as Lessor. Is it legally correct?",

The patta transfer and lease agreement done by Durai is not legally valid and maintainable. Therefore there is no question of Durai inheriting a share in the property. 2. Mother of Ganesh always had one fourth share out of her son's property, hence the release deed executed by her with regard to her undivided one fourth share in the property is valid as she's recognized as one among the legal heirs of her deceased son, as per Hindu succession act. 3. No, it is not legally valid, you may read the first point of my reply above.",

I arrived at the gate precisely at 5:27 AM. However, the person at the boarding gate denied entry, stating that the gate was closed. The boarding pass specifies that passengers should reach the gate 25 minutes prior to departure. INDIGO staff did not call me on my mobile before closing the gate. In my previous experiences with airlines like Emirates, Air Asia, and Air India, they always call before the gate closes. The INDIGO staff were rude and lacked empathy towards passengers. Is there any way I can file a complaint in consumer court? Can someone provide guidance? Thanks. I am visiting VTZ on an important business visit.",

Generally in such cases they accommodate you in another flight at no extra costs. If nothing of that sort occurred here then you can lodge complaint with the DG of Civil Aviation. Thereafter file case for compensation and damages before the consumer forum.",

You can very much file a consumer complaint in District Consumer Commission under new Consumer Protection Act, 2019, proceedings are very fast under new Act. You will get refund of fare paid with interest, cost of complaint, compensation for mental agony, which can be handsome amount and lawyer’ fee. You need not appear in District Consumer Commission.",

            "Dear Client, Regarding the hospital’s not having bills ready with the authorities for cashless claims, it may be because of organisational internal billing and reimbursement policies of Tamil Nadu government pensioners insurance. This is because they have the flexibility of direct settlement with the insurance provider, although they don’t provide detailed bills for the patients. . Thus, when choosing the option of direct payment, they present bills as part of the essential observance of the procedure that is required if you consider receiving a refund. The actual fact that one has to pay an amount of 3 lakhs in advance shows that normally this coverage pays for 80% of the claim, leaving the actual bill amount to be paid by the patient; however, not providing a bill in a ‘cashless claim’ seems very non-transparent. To determine why such a policy is implemented, it would be more appropriate to press the hospital for answers or contact the insurer if those are the terms of payment.",

However, because of the gravity of the mentioned offences (IPC 120B, 467, and the PMLA), you can ask the magistrate to transfer the case to the higher court if necessary, but first, the complaint has to be lodged before a magistrate, who then will decide whether to continue the trial at a lower court or transfer the case to a superior court.

        "full_text": "Domestic violent husband threatens suicide if I file complaint. Hello I'm in a very strange predicament where I am married to a man for whom beating his wife is very common. I had gotten used to it but over the years this has gotten worse and I'm suffering more grievous injuries whenever he attacks me nowadays. Our 2 kids are getting older and observing all this and I don't want them to see that this is how their parents are. I'm worried my 7 yr old son is showing violent streaks. I want to divorce him and live in my parents home where I can take care of the children. But I am financially dependent on him for their care as I gave up my job for marriage and having kids. However, whenever I try to have any meaningful conversation or try to reason with him, he gets aggressive again and that scares me. He threatens that he will commit suicide and write all my family's names and mine in the suicide note and send us to jail. I'm really afraid of this as my aged mother should not have to suffer even with having to deal with a police investigation. Nor do I want such incident to affect my siblings families either who are all happily married in their own homes. I've researched and found that I can file domestic violence complaints but I dont want him to go to jail or cause him to lose his job as my kids are dependent on finances he can provide. Hence I'd like to ask if there is a way in which I can just file for divorce from him, take custody of the children and get maintenance on these grounds? Will I still need to file any police complaint? How can I safeguard myself and my family if he does commit suicide when any court summons get delievered to him?

There were some initial adjustment issues so we use to fight a lot. She use to fight with my mother as well. She even went home for two and a half month (just after living with me for just two months) without giving me the idea that she isn't coming back. Somehow we convinced her that we'll live separately and on that context she came back. We moved out of my parents house in one month after she came back. But soon again fights started happening and one day it got worse and she left again. I said i want divorce but she refused. So after 6 months after the fight she filed a complaint to the police. We did not speak for these 6 months but our last conversation was about how I wanted the divorce but she doesn't want divorce, she wants to continue the relation. Now I have specific questions 1. what exact cases can be filed against me in the FIR ? 2. If I have proof that in our last conversation she wanted to live with me and now after 6 months she is filing DV complaint against me. Does that make my case strong? Asking this because she has accused me of hitting her (which never really happened) 3. What exactly is mental harassment? I was reading that mental harassment isn't really a thing in the penal code. it is related to some kind of other things like Mental harassment for dowry, or work place etc. If that is the case, the do i need to proof that I didn;t take dowry or asked for dowry? Suppose she has the recording of my mother saying some bad things about her in general (no abusive language or anything, but saying stuff about her parents that they are liars and not good people), does that count as mental harassment? If yes, then in what sense? Also what kind of proofs would negate such an accusation 3. What exactly does the High court looks at for FIR quashing? If looking at the evidence and judging that its not a valid case then isn't that a normal case in the court? how exactly is FIR quashing thing different? 4. She has named some of my family members in the complaint who hardly interacted with her (like met only once or twice). If their names are dropped from the FIR then is there any legal way to punish her for wrongly including the name of innocent people? 5. She is claiming istridhan which is already with her. Is there any way to confirm or check that? How can I submit any proofs to show that I dont have it 6. The complaint consist of wrong phrases or words spoken to her by my family. Now a friend of mine(lawyer) said that in case she has written those things to her mother in the whatsapp, that can be counted as evidence. is that true? if yes, then what are the counter proofs I can show ? 7.

            "Dear Client, 1. Possible Cases in the FIR: If your wife has filed a complaint, commonplace charges underneath the FIR can also consist of domestic violence (Section 498A of the IPC), dowry harassment, and likely physical assault. The unique sections will depend upon her allegations and the evidence she affords. 2. Strength of Your Case: Proof of your final conversation where she expressed a preference to retain the connection can be useful. It can suggest that the allegations of abuse or violence won't align with her previous stance, probably weakening her case. 3. Mental Harassment: While'mental harassment' in step with se isn't a standalone offence inside the penal code, it's often taken into consideration beneath domestic violence or cruelty (Section 498A). If she accuses you of mental harassment, you need to reveal that no dowry demands have been made. Statements by way of your mother, while not the best, no longer commonly meet the felony general for harassment unless they were abusive or threatening. 4. FIR Quashing: The High Court quashes FIRs in the event that they discover the criticism lacks substance or is frivolous. It appears to be prima facie evidence of abuse of the legal method. Quashing differs from an ordeal in that it prevents useless litigation if the FIR is baseless. 5. False Accusations Against Family: If family members are wrongly implicated, they are able to seek to have their names eliminated from the FIR. Post-acquittal or quashing, they are probably able to record a defamation suit against her for fake allegations. 6. Stridhan Claims: To deal with the fake claims of Stridhan, accumulate and publish any evidence of her ownership of these gadgets. This may want to encompass pictures, receipts, or written communication indicating that she has them. 7. WhatsApp Evidence: If she documented her circle of relatives' court cases about your own family in WhatsApp messages, it may be used as evidence. To counter, offer evidence showing a different narrative, inclusive of messages showing goodwill or agreements on different problems. 8. Monetary Extraction Admission: If she admits throughout CAW periods that the criticism is to extract cash, record or file this admission. This could be pivotal in discrediting her claims and demonstrating a malafide purpose. 9. DV Complaint with the Aid of Mother: Your mom can record a DV complaint against your spouse if she experienced abuse or harassment. This should encompass intellectual or emotional abuse at some point in your spouse’s stay, highlighting that harassment is not one-sided."

The quality of construction is substandard, and the builder is attempting to compromise on quality and cut corners. Many of the promised items have been delivered with shortcuts. Moreover, the builder has asked owners to take possession and begin interior work before the completion of the project. Due to a rise in city rents, EMIs on flat, many owners have taken over their flats, done interior work, completed registration, and made full payments, yet the builder has failed to complete the property, and people have started residing in the flats finding now solution. Furthermore, the builder has initiated temporary charges claiming that the percentage of occupancy is not sufficient to begin the builder's one-year maintenance. Several individuals have paid these charges, while others have decided to wait until the project is completed and the builder initiates maintenance. However, after one year, the builder sent a notification stating that his \"free\" maintenance period is over and that he will cease services starting next month.

Current situation: One of the sister is close to her deathbed and reached out to my mother to sell the house as it is old and not usable and divide the sell proceeds equally within the 3 sisters. My mother agreed but the other sister is not ready to sell the house. When my mother raised the point to see the house she made statements like - 'Both of you do not have any legal rights to sell the house'.

Question: We have tried our best to build consensus between the sisters but the eldest sister is not ready to listen and her intentions seems to be towards claiming the whole house for her son. It does seem like the issue will be resolved with talks. We are inclined towards selling the house as it is very old and is not a condition to live. And since it's in a different city we don't have any plans to use it.

Current Calculation: 635 (offered) - 600 (existing) + 45 (balcony) = 75 sq ft additional purchase. Key Points: 1. MOFA vs. RERA: Ensure clarity on what areas are included in the RERA area. RERA often includes common areas and balconies, which are not part of MOFA. 2. Guidelines: MOFA mandates clear disclosure of carpet area, and any reduction must be compensated. RERA requires transparent communication of the carpet area and additional spaces. 3. Balcony Condition: Ensure the conditional addition of the balcony is clearly agreed upon.

            "Dear Client, First, you should start the corrections by editing the Aadhar card, which is the basic card attached to other records as well. To correct a spelling, the following steps need to be followed, which include completing a name correction application online through the UIDAI website or going to an Aadhar enrollment centre to fill out the same with appropriate official documents, for example, passports and school marksheets that have the right spelling. The sequence of ID proof, PAN card, driving licence, bank accounts, bank post office, mutual fund investments, and income tax returns should be followed immediately after updating the Aadhar card. Every institution has its own process of changing names, and the name correction process often entails the use of a properly filled-out name correction form, identity proof reflecting the new name, and, in some cases, a copy of the new Aadhar card. However, this might take much time; though, it ensures consistency concerning competitors’ actions and legal issues. It is essential to have updated documents because they support various activities, such as financial business operations, work with taxes, travel, and legal situations."

            "Supreme Court: In a case where a citizen, who suffers from a writer’s cramp, was denied a scribe in the civil services’ examination, the 3-judge bench of Dr. DY Chandrachud*, Indira Banerjee and Sanjiv Khanna, JJ has held that writer’s cramp Forms part of Entry IV of the Schedule to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act 2016) and “To deny the facility of a scribe in a situation such as the present would negate the valuable rights and entitlements which are recognised by the RPwD Act 2016.” Part III of our Constitution does not explicitly include persons with disabilities within its protective fold. However, much like their able-bodied counterparts, the golden triangle of Articles 14, 19 and 21 applies with full force and vigour to the disabled. The RPwD Act 2016 seeks to operationalize and give concrete shape to the promise of full and equal citizenship held out by the Constitution to the disabled and to execute its ethos of inclusion and acceptance.” Section 3 casts an affirmative obligation on the government to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy (i) the right to equality; (ii) a life with dignity; and (iii) respect for their integrity equally with others. By recognizing a statutory right and entitlement on the part of persons who are disabled, Section 3 seeks to implement and facilitate the fulfillment of the constitutional rights of persons with disabilities. You can give a representation based on supreme court judgment",

            "Dear Client, Legally, you have several options to seek redress and accommodations. The Supreme Court's judgement in Vikash Kumar v. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is indeed relevant to your situation. Here’s a detailed explanation: Facts and Decisions in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC In Vikash Kumar v. UPSC (2021), the petitioner suffered from a similar neurological condition that impaired his writing ability. He requested reasonable accommodations to take a civil service examination, including the provision of a scribe. The UPSC rejected his request, prompting him to challenge their decision. The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Vikash Kumar, emphasising the following key points: 1. Rights of Persons with Disabilities: The Court underscored the rights of individuals with disabilities to reasonable accommodations under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act). This Act mandates non-discrimination and provides for necessary accommodations to enable persons with disabilities to perform their roles effectively. 2. Definition of Disability: The Court broadened the interpretation of “disability” to include conditions like writer's cramp, stressing that the impairment need not be visible or permanent as long as it hampers the individual’s ability to perform daily activities. 3. Obligation of Employers: The Court held that employers, including public sector entities, have a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities. This includes reassignment to suitable positions where the disability would not impede job performance. Legal Options and Steps for Your Case 1. Request Reasonable Accommodations in Writing: Submit a formal, written request to your higher authorities and HR department, outlining your condition, its impact on your job performance, and the specific accommodations you are seeking. Reference is made to the RPWD Act and the Supreme Court judgement in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC. 2. Consult with medical professionals: Obtain detailed medical documentation from your neurologist or other healthcare providers. These documents should describe your condition, its impact on your ability to write, and recommended accommodations. 3. File a grievance: If your initial requests are ignored or denied, file a formal grievance through your bank’s internal grievance redressal mechanism. Make sure to document all instances of harassment and lack of accommodation. 4. Approach the Equal Opportunity Cell (if available): Many public sector organisations have an Equal Opportunity Cell or a similar body responsible for addressing issues related to discrimination and accommodations for employees with disabilities. Approach this body with your complaint. 5. Legal Action: If internal remedies fail, you can file a complaint with the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (CCPD) or the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities. These bodies have the authority to investigate and take action on complaints of non-compliance with the RPWD Act. You can also consider filing a writ petition in the High Court under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution, seeking a directive for your employer to provide reasonable accommodations and to stop the harassment. Relevant Case Law In addition to Vikash Kumar v. UPSC, consider referencing these cases: Jeeja Ghosh & Another v. Union of India: This case reinforced the rights of persons with disabilities to equal treatment and accommodations. Bhavya Nain v. University of Delhi highlighted the need for reasonable accommodations in educational and employment settings for persons with disabilities. Your condition qualifies as a disability under the RPWD Act, and your employer is legally obligated to provide reasonable accommodations. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Vikash Kumar v. UPSC supports your case, emphasising the duty of employers to accommodate employees with disabilities. You have the right to request reassignment or other accommodations and to seek redress through internal grievance mechanisms or legal channels if necessary. Seek legal counsel to assist with drafting formal requests and potential legal actions. Your case highlights the need for compliance with disability rights legislation and the importance of creating an inclusive work environment.",

            "Dear Client, You are right; your present position is worrisome, and it is a worrying indicator of your rights to food, to live with dignity, and to be protected from death. Under these circumstances, action based on legal procedures is inevitable in order to avoid further economic loss and to defend oneself. For that reason, it is necessary to rush to a lawyer for an application for an order to restrain the moneylenders and the bank from demanding and collecting interest and principal amounts until the Patna High Court furnishes its jurisdiction. It will help you avoid reaching a point where you have no money to pay your bills, and once you have a steady job, you should be able to minimise your spending and repay the money borrowed. Your lawyer can then appeal to the judge and explain that it is unfair and unreasonable for a moneylender to ask for exorbitant interest rates and other penalties given the circumstances surrounding the borrower’s debt trap. Emphasising your acknowledgment of the infringement of rights because of the money that you are expected to pay may help build your argument for the relief needed. Also, your lawyer should apply for a stay or grace period, which should be two years, as you suggested. As suggested, you should manage your factoring to evade debts. In this period, interest accrual and penalty charges are likely to put more pressure on your financial capability, but the court may agree to suspend these charges. Document collection is also critical, mainly loan agreements, bank statements, and any writing that the education department will have sent to either the lender or the debtor. Your legal counsellor, who will be assigned to your case, will then move for the appropriate legal redress in order to give you the relief you deserve. It is thus advised that you seek legal help as soon as you can so that your emergency financial situation can be addressed comprehensively and all your constitutional rights can be defended."

Subject: Legal Implications of a Debit Freeze on Firm's Bank Account by One Partner Dear Forum Members, I am seeking legal advice regarding a dispute within our firm. We are three partners, all family members, with equal shareholding in the firm. One of our partners has a dispute with the other two partners and has written a letter to our bank requesting a debit freeze on our current account and Fixed Deposit Receipts (FDR) in the name of the firm, citing the internal dispute. This partner is currently unwilling to resolve the dispute and is preventing us from operating the bank account and accessing the FDR. My questions are as follows: Is it legally permissible for a single partner to request a freeze on the firm's bank account with a simple letter, given the equal shareholding among partners? What steps can we take to regain access to the bank account and continue the operations of the firm? I would appreciate any guidance or suggestions on how to proceed in this situation. Thank you. Sincerely",

            "Dear CLient, A partner cannot afford to risk sending a letter asking that the account of the firm be frozen without prior clearance, which, in view of the equal shareholding, is unlawful. To regain access to the bank account and continue firm operations, you and the other partner can take the following steps: 1. Contact the bank and inform them of the situation and ask them to unfreeze the accounts. Submit a proof of equal shareholding and that one partner had asked to freeze it improperly. 2. It could be useful to set up a meeting of the partners where they could discuss the problem and possibly solve it with the help of a mediator if needed. 3. If the partner continues to resist having the account and FDR frozen, the issue should go to court and get an order from the court to unfreeze the account and FDR. However, seeking individual legal advice and assistance from an advocate for assistance and consultation may be advisable to undertake this efficiently.",

        "full_text": "Buying a resale flat in an under construction building. I am planning to purchase a resale flat in an under construction building. The project has been delayed for sometime (Covid also one part of the delay). The end of the year is a 3rd RERA extension that the builder has got. However it still looks far from getting completed and may get delayed by a few months more. I have paid a token to the investor for the flat, but now the investor doesn’t want to get into a Tripartite deal cause he has to pay GST again for it. The problem with paying an investor is the bank disperses all the funds and doesn’t hold back. In that case I can’t even hold back cash till I get possession of the flat. Please suggest",
        "answers": [
            "Don’t purchase the flat there is no guarantee that possession would be delivered within stipulated period further since all funds have been disbursed by bank you are stuck with the project in addition builder would charge high transfer charges",
            "It is not advisable to proceed without a tripartite agreement. The bank will not disburse loan without any agreement. The GST amount paid by the original buyer can be paid by you because GST is payable only once and not by subsequent buyer too.",
            "Discuss with your bank if they can structure the loan disbursement in tranches based on construction progress or possession. This would ensure funds are held back until you get possession.",
            "Dear Client, Marketing an apartment for resale in a building under construction that continues to have construction delays was undoubtedly fraught with some difficulties, particularly in relation to the concerns regarding the inability of an investor reluctant to sign the Tripartite Agreement. The primary concern for consideration here is that your interests are safeguarded, especially because this project has been experiencing some setbacks, and the investor's decision to back out and opt not to be part of the Tripartite Agreement makes the transaction more challenging. A potential solution is to work out with the investor that an initial payment will be made contingent on the agreed-upon amount of future revenue. In a spirit of negotiation, you could suggest a plan through which a part of the payment is made before the launch of the project and the rest of the amount is paid and retained in trust until ownership is handed over. This also ensures that the investor gets at least some funds upon the completion of the first part, and you are also shielded in case there are likely to be further delays. This arrangement would also call for a precise legal framework that would lay down various provisions in a bid to unlock the remaining balance. No doubt it is wise to consult a lawyer to draw up or at least to inspect this agreement in order to make sure that all such clauses are cogent and the interests of the parties are shielded. The other thing that can be done is to talk with the bank of your choice and possibly come to an agreement on how the loan is paid out in phases based on project progress or possession. Banks generally release funds with respect to construction work completed, and you can negotiate a specific payment schedule you feel would safeguard a part of the funds until you take possession. This might entail explanations with the bank and, with the help of records of the current situation and the manner in which the progress of the project is being slowed, getting consent. If the investor remains inflexible and the bank cannot accommodate your request for a conditional disbursement plan, you may need to reconsider the purchase. Paying the full amount without any assurance of possession exposes you to significant risks, especially in a delayed project. The investor's reluctance to pay GST again suggests they are looking to minimise their costs at your expense, which could indicate potential red flags in the transaction. It's essential to assess the potential for further delays and the overall credibility of the builder. If the delays seem likely to extend beyond the current RERA extension and there is no clear timeline for completion, it might be prudent to explore other options.",
            "- As per the RERA Act, if the builder is delaying in construction & delay in possession, then the builder will have to pay 10% interest on the value of the property for delayed possession of flats. - Hence, if builder fails to delivers the possession of the flat to you on time, then you can cancel the agreement due to his fault and you are liable to get full refund of paid amount with 10 percent interest. - Further, if you get the possession of the said flat lately, then also you can claim 10% compensation from the builder. - How the bank sanctioned /disburse the loan in the absence of a Tripartite agreement."

My mom and sis prepared a special power of attorney to authorise me to sign the sale deed at the registrar's office in Kerala. Registration went well, no issues. the special power of attorney (stamp value 100Rs) prepared in Delhi was notarized only not registered. Sub-registrar in Kerala during sale deed registration didn't raise any concern and completed the process. Now, the new owner has approached the bank (SBI in Kerla) for a loan on top of this property.

To rectify this they need an affidavit/confirmation registered mentioning the old POA and the executed sale deed details. Bank lawyers in Kerala don't know this can be done at a registrar's office in Delhi. They know it can be done in Kerala but at the moment my mom and sis are not in a position to go to Kerala.

            "As per law, the POA used for transaction pertaining to immovable proeprty has to be executed on a registered document only and not by an unregistered document.

However, the original POA was not notarized and not registered, and in any case, if the stamp value of the document does not conform to the legal requirements of stamp duties in the State of Kerala, at least a registered affidavit or confirmation should be able to treat the wrong. If your mother and sister want to get over this, they can execute an affidavit in Delhi, where the particulars of producing the original power of attorney and the actual sale deed will be stated. This affidavit should particularly mention that you had the original power of attorney to do the following for the sale of property in Kerala. Moreover, there should be details concerning the sale deed, and all parties should have knowledge about the transaction beforehand. After the affidavit is drafted, it should be lodged with the registrar of the stated city. In the case of registration, the common-law partners, or your mother and sister in this case, will have to go to the registrar, who will then cause the affidavit to be sworn by them. This registered affidavit can then be procured from the office of the subregistrar and submitted to the bank in Kerala to meet the above requirement. Though it is a standard practice to follow while rectifying inconsistencies in title deeds across different states, it is wise to seek legal advice from an attorney with knowledge of real estate law in Delhi and Kerala. They can help determine whether all the legal requirements in the preparation of the affidavit have been met, not to mention issues related to registration. It will also assist in eschewing additional problems with the bank’s verification process and simplifying the process of acquiring the loan application. Lastly, it is for this reason that you can actually handle this at the registrar’s office in Delhi by preparing and forwarding an affidavit that will consist of the details in regard to the original POA and the sale deed. It will also involve consulting a legal professional to make sure that the responses in the affidavit are proper and that the affidavit is properly drafted and recorded to address the bank’s concerns."

When he got to know the RWA was filing a cheque bounce case on him he used a temporary water plumbing issue where water was stopped for an hour to claim we had cut his water - when that wasn't the case. We never cut his water. 2. Taking that as a reason - he then proceeded to block the society's entry and exit (same gate) using his cars causing distress to residents who couldn't get in or out with their vehicles for a good few hours. We have video proof of all this. 3. As society residents started complaining and stressing about blocked entry and exit - I had mentioned on the society's common WhatsApp group that the 'rotund fellow in the video is acting like a goonda' and harassing residents from entering and exiting. He also threatened to erase the Association from the Registrar - and calls the entire Association illegal because ' we didn't take his permission to form Association' 4. When we called police to inform them of the same, they did not turn up. Only responded when Tweeted about it. They falsely claim they had shown up but no one was there. We didn't get any registered numbers on SMS for calling 112. 5. Next day cops call me threatening to file serious criminal charges if I don't come to the station. 6. When I go the station, they proceed to take the maintenance defaulter's fake version as a complaint and not register my complaint and threaten me with fake criminal cases until I settle the matter/complaint. I provided a statement counter to the defaulter's complaint stating what had actually happened countering his version that I was stopping him from going to his apartments. This ordeal lasted 14 hours. Looking at my ordeal, the rest of the society more or less abandons me and won't come to the police station. 7. Now, this defaulter sends me a defamation notice for 50 Lakh saying I illegally stopped him from going to his apartment when in fact he deliberately blocked the entry/exit. He is claiming defamation on the grounds of me calling him 'rotund' and 'acting like a goonda' on WhatsApp group.

Facing a defamation notice, especially under such contentious circumstances, can be daunting. Here is a comprehensive approach to address the defamation notice and tackle ongoing harassment, with relevant legal provisions and strategies. Understanding Defamation and Relevant Legal Provisions Defamation Law in India: Defamation, under Indian law, is addressed under Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, which defines defamation and Section 500 of the IPC which prescribes punishment for defamation. Section 499 IPC: Defamation involves making or publishing any imputation concerning any person, intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm the reputation of such person. Section 500 of the IPC Provides for punishment with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, with a fine, or with both. To constitute defamation, three elements must be established: 1. Imputation: There must be an imputation made or published. 2. Harm: The imputation must be made with the intention of harming the reputation of the person. 3. Knowledge: The imputation must be known or reasonably believed to harm the person’s reputation. Civil Defamation: The person aggrieved can also file a civil suit claiming damages for defamation. Steps to Respond to the Defamation Notice 1. Engage Legal Counsel: Immediately consult a lawyer experienced in defamation cases. They will help you draft a formal response to the defamation notice and guide you through the legal intricacies. 2. Prepare a Detailed response: Your response should clarify the context in which the statements were made. Emphasise the ongoing issues with maintenance dues and the obstruction of entry and exit points. Highlight that the statements made in the WhatsApp group were in response to the disruptive behaviour, not intended to defame but to inform and manage the situation. 3. Evidence Collection: Compile all evidence that supports your claims, including video footage of the entry/exit blockade, records of bounced checks, and any communications related to the maintenance dues. Document the sequence of events, including the interaction with the police and any witness statements from other residents. 4. Justification and Truth Defence: Under Section 499 IPC, truth is a defence to defamation if the statement was made for the public good. Emphasise that your statement was true and made in the interest of the society's members’ welfare. Addressing the Ongoing Harassment 1. File a Police complaint: lodge a detailed complaint against the defaulter for harassment, obstruction, and disruption of peace. Since there is already a bias, ensure the complaint is comprehensive and includes all supporting evidence. If the local police are unresponsive, escalate the matter to higher authorities, such as the District Superintendent of Police or the State Human Rights Commission. 2. Civil Suit for Injunction: Consider filing a civil suit seeking an injunction against the defaulter from harassing you and other society members. This can include an order to restrain him from blocking entry and exit points and interfering with society’s functioning. 3. Society’s Legal Framework: Ensure the society’s rules and regulations are documented and followed. The RWA can impose penalties on defaulters as per the society’s bylaws. Seek legal advice on enforcing these bylaws effectively. Case Law on Defamation and Public Good: Subramanian Swamy v. Union of India, Ministry of Law (2016): The Supreme Court upheld that truth and public good are valid defences against defamation. Consumer Protection Act, 2019: If the defaulter’s actions are severely affecting the living conditions in society, the RWA may file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act for unfair trade practices, if applicable. Responding to a defamation notice and addressing ongoing harassment requires a strategic and legally sound approach. By engaging legal counsel, preparing a robust response, collecting evidence, and leveraging relevant legal provisions, you can effectively counter the defamation claims and protect your rights and reputation. Simultaneously, taking steps to mitigate ongoing harassment through legal channels will ensure the smooth functioning of society and uphold the rule of law."

As per the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Criminal Code (CrPC), the investigating officer is responsible for ensuring the arrest and prosecution of all the accused. Aspects of the FIR are serious and call for thorough investigation and arrest of all the accused. In the case of an accused who is absconding but not cooperating, the investigating officer should also consider arrest if non-cooperation hampers the investigation, as provided under CrPC. Failure to cooperate to ensure the smooth running of the investigation may be valid grounds for arrest.",
            "Dear Client, The investigating officer is correct that offences that are triable only for imprisonment for a term of less than seven years sometimes come as a category of offences that fall under Section 41A of the CrPC, where a notice to appear can be given instead of a warrant of arrest. However, problems come with the delay in such action and the implications of bias arising from the fact that the accused is the police. First, there is a need to clarify the existence of the accused on the list of individuals who have been declared absconding. This should, of course, be recorded in the police force documents, and there should be attempts to apprehend them if they are indeed fugitives. If you have not been served, then take advantage of the fact that it has been 11 months since the FIR was filed, and you can tackle the issue of the chargesheet not being filed. It could also mean sheer neglect or maybe deliberate tarpitting by the police in presenting the charge sheet. To address the situation: Present an affidavit of complaint and/or representation to the superior officer that the investigating officer has not initiated proper action as per the court order and the superior officer’s direction. Go to the High Court either with a contempt petition or a writ petition for direction to the investigating officer to do his job under the law, as it is in regard to the investigation and any subsequent arrests, which should not be made with any prejudice. Indicate that the investigation can be supervised by the court, especially on occasions where police officers are the accused. It is important to note that all telephone and face-to-face communications should be recorded, and there should be an official record of the communication to support the case being presented to the higher authorities and court.",

My previous office given permission to apply for Level-10 post & issued Experience Certificate by mentioning new office name & Vigilance Clearance. My application was forwarded to our regional office for further forwarding to our HQs. Meanwhile I have done my written exam & waiting for results. Instead of forwarding my application to our HQs, Regional office itself replied that NOC can't be issued due to Shortage of Manpower. (Regional office suppose to forward my application with remark that NOC NOT RECOMMENDED, they violated procedure). (Other regional offices allowed NOCs). Meanwhile my written exam result has come & shortlisted for interview and interview date also announced. So I again requested my office to forward my application to our HQs for issuing me NOC to attend interview, but my office (local office) didn't forward my application (not allowed me to forward directly to HQs) and replied to my request that you should not attend interview as regional office denied your NOC. I thought that if I fight for my right and if I am not cleaning interview means I have to survive in the same office, so I requested and begged my local office head to allow me to attend interview, he allowed me and sanctioned my leave for that interview date with the condition (unofficial) that I should apply personal resignation instead of technical resignation. I have attended the interview by submitting my experience certificate and Vigilance Clearance at the time of interview and they allowed me for interview. Finally I selected for level-10 post and requested my local office head for technical resignation, he said that regional office denied your NOC, how you attended interview, I will take action on you, I will not relieve you like that he started, then I also made one letter stating all injustice happened to me to forward to our top Headquarters and shown to him, then he said that he will allow me personal resignation. I didn't have much time to join in new office (20 days time) & my new office required relieving order also, so I agreed for personal resignation and took my relieving order and joined my new office. I have explained all these to my new office, they said you have to start fresh service here, your previous service will not be added. I said ok.

            "Dear Client, Firstly, it is important to understand that the best course of action is to realise that one has most likely, however, become a staking victim of a scam. The famous tendency that scammers use is to ask for a small amount of money compared to the promised sum, and after that, they vanish. In light of the services discussed in this paper, this complicates the problem as we try to find a solution for it. From a legal point of view, web-based selling of sexual services, including cam shows, is completely legal and may be unlawful in some contexts or in certain countries or states. In many places, such transactions remain either unlawful or, at the very least, are vague and without a clearly defined legal status, which often makes it almost impossible for a buyer to seek compensation for the alleged fraud through legal means. Filing a Complaint and Chargeback:Filing a Complaint and Chargeback: NPCI and Bank Chargeback: You can apply for a chargeback with NPCI or apply directly with the bank However, one must note that banks often need a valid reason for processing chargebacks or reversing a transaction. Specifically for the type of payment you received and the service being offered, it can be challenging without jeopardising the legal aspects of the case to defend your stand, let alone admit to prostitution. Consumer Forums: There are solutions available for reporting instances of online fraud the consumer forums or the helpline number, but these may not be the most effective option for challenging issues related to adult services because of said legal ambiguities. Reporting the Scam: This way, you have to be careful when reporting the scam, considering the legal consequences of doing so. However, returning the money to the person is the main focus, and the revelation of the details of the transaction can have negative repercussions. In some jurisdictions, just confessing to attempt to access such services or participating in such a service supplier. Alternative Steps: Cease Further Contact: It means that one should cut any ties to the individual to avoid further financial losses or getting caught up in such a situation. Privacy and Security: However, it is recommended to use the slot at the hotel or any other private location that will guarantee the privacy and security of the individuals involved. If the scammer has any of your details, then even you might be at risk of identity theft or more attempts to con you. Awareness and Caution: To do this, one may argue that it is pertinent to draw lessons from this experience for future occurrences to be more careful. Do not buy or seek services from company or persons whose legal nature of business is questionable or not well defined. Consult a Legal Advisor: Before proceeding any further with the steps outlined on this web site to report the issue or to file for a chargeback, one must seek the advice of a lawyer. They can then recommend which legal route to take with the case while taking into consideration your own circumstances."

            "Kul Kayada is a provision of protection given to the tenants of the land under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Act 1948. U/s 43 of the said Act any land acquired by a tenant shall not be entitled to be sold, transferred without the prior approval of the Collector. The procedure for the tenant to purchase the land is laid down in Sec. 32G of the bombay Tenancy and agricultural reform Act. It enjoins the Agricultural Land Tribunal constituted under Sec. 67 to publish a public notice calling upon the tenants, the landlords and any other interested person to appear before it on a speci- fied date. The Tribunal is also required to issue individual notices to the landlords and the tenants, and thereafter to decide the competing cases.",

Owner has every right to evict you from tenanted land. your possession in the capacity of tenant does not matter nor it create any right or title or interest in the land. Owner for his personal use also can get property vacated.",
            "Dear Client, The particular legal rights and obligations in situations involving \"Kul Kayda\" (tenant-farmer or tenant-rights legislation) are determined by the state and local laws controlling tenancy and land rights. Nonetheless, the following broad ideas will assist you in comprehending your stance and bolstering your argument: Familiarize yourself on the legal provisions under the specific legal jurisdiction of your state with reference to tenancy and land rights – “Kul” (Tenant Farmers). These laws can offer safeguard as far as eviction is concerned and even certain procedures in split of land are present. Documentation: The buyer should make sure he/she has all the necessary documents to support title deed and demonstrate physical possession of the land for an extended period. This means tenancy receipts, rent receipts, tax receipts or any other communication with the land lord over the period of letting . Land Records: Go to the registrar of local land transfer to ensure your name and current tenure are correct. The longer the possession is, especially if continuous, the better the chance of presenting a valid pretense to the property. Legal Precedents: Consult a lawyer if there are any legal backing that can be used to argue the case or do a research on the legal framework. This is particularly true since prior examples are compelling in establishing different arguments in other similar kinds of matters. Municipal Regulations: This means that the land may be located in a municipal area hence implying that there may be some other laws or tenancy protection. Search for tenant protection laws along with other matters related to land division in the specific municipality or city. Legal Assistance: Seek the services of a lawyer who has knowledge in the area of law concerning property ownership and occupancy. This includes legal advice that can be given to a specific context and assist in understanding one’s legal position. Negotiation: If possible and if you have the time, sit down with the landowner and discuss. It is important to hire an attorney to assist as a middleman and possibly come up with an agreement acceptable to both parties Other than that, there can be legal advice on how to handle the termination of employment without going to court. Strengthening Your Case: Gather proof of your property possession and utilisation in the land over time, this may include giving out testimonies from neighbouring community members or individuals who have testified on your behalf of your utilisation of the land, and oddments made on the land. Government Assistance: It is also important to find out whether there is a way to legally self help especially in the event the tenant farmers are on the receiving end of such injustices. There are those states where there are particular bodies or boards that focus on the cases of the tenants and the landlords. Hope this helps!",
            "The Maharashtra Tenancy And Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 This law is also called “Kul Kayda”.

        "full_text": "Can I travel abroad with court order. I was notified that I have an LOC pending issued by SP office when I reached Mumbai airport from UK. Initially I was told by immigration police that I will be detained and arrested but later they had a communication with SP Office and came to know that no arrest warrant was issued and they informed me that once they get a mail communication from SP Office they will allow me to travel on my own. Once getting mail from SP office they handed me the passport and left me to travel on my own. Immigration police asked me to write a letter that I will be attending court. Later I went and surrendered myself in court and got a court order that I will be released and I should attend all court hearings and there was no travel or any other conditions imposed on the order. 1. My question is what would have been the communication shared to immigration from SP OFFICE? 2. Am I eligible to travel with the court order which never mentioned about any travel restrictions. 3. Is my LoC revoked or lifted? Since after getting mail from SP OFFICE they allows me to travel by myself. If while travelling again is the court order which never stated about any conditions or restriction on travel is fine? Am I be allowed to travel back and forth to attend my hearings.

As there is no travel restriction you may travel abroad but you must make sure that you are present before court on the court hearing dates. 3. If you are again stopped by immigration department at airport then you may understand taht the LOC has not been removed, in that circumstance you may have to obtain permission from court to travel abroad",
            "Dear Client, Communication from the SP Office to Immigration The communication from the SP Office to the immigration authorities likely clarified your legal status and confirmed that no arrest warrant was issued against you. This would have reassured the immigration officials that, while an LOC was active, it did not necessitate immediate detention or arrest. The SP Office might have also communicated any specific instructions, such as your requirement to attend court hearings, which allowed the immigration officials to proceed accordingly. Since the court order explicitly states that you should attend all court hearings and does not impose any travel restrictions, you are generally eligible to travel. The court's lack of mention regarding travel restrictions implies that you are free to travel, provided you return for your court hearings. Always carry a copy of this court order when traveling to demonstrate your compliance with legal requirements. Status of Your LOC The fact that you were allowed to travel after the SP Office communicated with the immigration officials suggests that the immediate concerns of the LOC were addressed, at least temporarily. However, this does not necessarily mean the LOC is revoked or lifted permanently. The LOC may still be active, and its enforcement could vary depending on the specifics of your case and the instructions from the SP Office. -Travel Preparations: Keep Documentation: Always take a copy of the court mandate with you when traveling. This will be important in demonstrating that you are following the court's orders. Legal Disclaimer: Check with your attorney before traveling to make sure you do not have anything pending that may interfere with your travel plans. -If Stopped by Immigration: Court Order: A court order which says that no implied order not to travel Inform them all you are doing is complying with the court order by going to all court hearing -Talking: You ask for immigration staff members to check in with the SP Office or elsewhere to confirm your status. Hope this helps!",

My wife has elder sister. My wife's brother expired due to covid in June 2021. Since that time my gf (would be wife) forced me to buy a flat in Bangalore where her sister bought so that her parents would live with us. Initially I hesitated but finally agreed to buy the property. Property cost was 86 lakhs. Out of 86, 65 lakhs was loan from bank and I paid 17 lakhs and she paid rest 10 lakhs from her pocket (6 lakhs was registration fee). My mother in law paid for interior and I don't know how much it costed. Monthly EMI of 50k started from Feb 2022. The initial EMI agreement was that she would pay half and I would pay half. The agreement was verbal and not written anywhere. But she didn't pay a single emi. 50k is debiting from my account only. Our house was asbestos so my then gf told to make a pucca house and then only come for marriage. We used all our savings to build a house and I took 5 lakh personal loan. Marriage was done on our side, so for that it costed 25 lakhs. My parents almost cleared the marriage expenses. Here comes the worst part. I used up all my savings for marriage and honeymoon and was left with 0 rupees. My salary at that time of marriage was 65k, which was exactly enough to pay house emi and personal loan. I told my wife about this and informed her to move to my native place which is Nellore. She denied telling that she couldn't adjust in Nellore. So for extra expenses, till today I took 15 lakhs of personal loan to maintain the lifestyle and pregnancy expenses, household expenses, her personal expenses. So house emi and my personal loan both combined, I have to pay 1 lakh per month. I didn't receive a single rupee from my inlaws though they are staying with us. During delivery time, they gave 50k. Apart from that I didn't receive a penny. Since marriage, my inlaws are staying in the house and when my wife and I had any quarell, she immediately jumps into our fight and intensifies it. This happened quite often and I got fed up. I recently got a job which is giving me 160k on hand. If I stay in Bangalore, house emi, personal emi, my lic, her lic, maid, flat maintenance, her expenses, my expenses, household expenses was turning out to be 180k. Still 20k hole from my pocket. I told my wife on 12 Apr 2024 about this and informed her to move to Nellore and put Bangalore house in rent after sending my inlaws to their village. She didn't agree and we had a fight. I left Bangalore and went to Nellore on 12 Apr. Today she sent a notice that I abandoned her, domestic abuse and violence which is false. I went and talked to her in Police Station. She simply told that if I stay in Bangalore with her and my inlaws, she will not file fir. If not she will file case with above issues. What shall I do?",

            "Dear Client, This is particularly paramount bearing in mind the above complications, which make it necessary to avoid haphazard advancement in this methodical approach to defend your interests and address the concerns adequately. To begin with, all the records should be kept in order, paying extra attention to your financial activities and the verbal agreements concluded with your wife. Documents to be compiled include the bank statements of EMI payments on the credit cards, written communications of the financial arrangements taken, and loan records incurred for household or personal reasons. It is useful in the event that there is a need to go to court due to some illegality. It is also important that any external influence, especially from in-laws, that has influenced your marriage in a negative way be included. Next, it is recommended to contact an attorney as soon as possible. If you’re unsure about your rights when going through the process, it would be wise to engage the services of a lawyer who focuses on family law. They can assist you in dealing with the notice that your wife has issued and can make you ready for any legal battle she might launch against you or any accusations she may make, such as abandonment, domestic abuse, and violence, among others. Your lawyer can also explain the legal consequences of your financial agreements and how they can be resolved, for example, by obtaining a legal resolution, continuing the legal process by obtaining legal separation, or seeking legal advice for an out-of-court settlement. Lastly, in this legal environment, it is the best if you keep talking to your wife calmly and in an understanding manner if you wish to reach a common agreement. You may wish to urge the suggestion to employ mediation as an option to address your disagreements without resorting to litigation. Should the situation worsen and legal processes are the only solution, your attorney will assist you with appropriate defence strategies and, possibly, claims for compensation for the monetary and, respectively, the emotional loss you have suffered. Hope this helps!",

Both Mumbai and goa are having jurisdiction. Goa has jurisdiction as you had married there, but there is absolutely no compulsion and you can choose to consider it as a secondary option if it seems inconvenient. For filing in Mumbai - You will need to provide a valid address proof to prove that you (petitioner) are living in Mumbai and are having jurisdiction of Mumbai to file a divorce case . Your Documents should have a Mumbai address such as (any one document is required )- voter Id, aadhar card , passport , gas connection bill are considered valid documents to file case in Mumbai . Secondly - You have a right to ask your wedding gold prior to signing divorce papers if in-laws are on good terms . Otherside usually gold is kept as last part of exchange on the last day of final court settlement in front of judge. Pls ensure to make note of gold(in grams) is with in-laws and will be exchanged on final decree day in ur divorce papers to avoid any problems. Certain other clauses are also important to mention in divorce proceedings which I could discuss better if I had more details of your case for which I will be at your service if required. Mutual divorce is the quickest and simplest way to get a divorce and usually has a 6 months cooling off period which can be waived off by convincing the judge to fast track the case. Warm regards.

If it is a mutual consent divorce you can get the case disposed within six months from the date of filing.",

Since you are presently residing in Mumbai and your husband is working in Abu Dhabi, you are entitled to file for divorce in Mumbai. This provision helps the petitioner’s right to record of their cutting-edge location of residence if the respondent is abroad. Regarding your wedding gold, you have the right to assert your personal property at any time. This may be performed independently of the divorce court cases. Here’s how you can proceed: 1. Formal Request: Send a proper letter on your husband and his circle of relatives soliciting for the return of your gold. 2. Police Complaint: If they decline, you can document a complaint with the police for the return of your streedhan (woman's belongings), which includes all jewellery and items acquired during the wedding. Legal Rights and Timelines Legal Rights: 1. Jurisdiction: You can document for divorce in Mumbai in keeping with the Indian Divorce Act, 1869. 2. Streedhan: You are entitled to your wedding gold and other non-public property, which have to be returned upon request. Coming to the timeline for divorce can vary. In instances of mutual consent divorce under the Indian Divorce Act, it generally takes around 6 to 18 months. If the divorce is contested, it could take longer due to court hearings and capacity appeals."

He has never raised this issue earlier and no communication from him ever before. Both our interpretation of the lease deed is also different. Pls advice.",
        "answers": [
            "1) increase in rent is after completion of 11 months ie from September 2021 2)you are bound to pay arrears of rent",
            "You have to pay escalation charges on completion of 11 months",
            "1. As per the narration, the increase in rent is effective after completion of eleven months in two thousand twenty one. 2. However you can negotiate with the landlord saying that you had interpreted that the five percent escalation will be enforced only after renewal of lease deed in two thousand twenty three.",
            "1. After every 11 months 2. If you can not pay the arrear rent you can leave the premises.",
            "1. The 5% increase in the monthly rental payment will be with effect from completion of the 12 months from the original date of lease agreement, i.e., it will be effected 21.10.2021 and every year thereafter. 2. Since you have agreed and accepted the terms as stated in the lease agreement you are bound by the clauses and have to pay the arrears of rental amount as well as the enhanced rental amount whether the landlord has intimated to you earlier or not. Please note that the enhancement of monthly rental amount shall be given effect after completion of one year i.e., 12 months and not on completion of 11 months, this clause of increase in monthly rental amount after 11 months makes no sense and cannot be legally valid."

        "full_text": "Registered will in Mumbai. Hello, We are in the process of estate planning and my parents have made a registered wills that divides the property between me and my sister. We are all in good terms and happy with whatever our parents are giving us. I just wanted to check, in case of death of any of our parents is registered will enough to do the transmission of property in Mumbai we have apartment in housing society. My parents want to do an easy transfer for us in the future without need of probate or any other hectic task. What would you suggest ?",
        "answers": [
            "Probate is mandatory in Mumbai. Better execute gift deed is easy and smooth transfer of title.",
            "Hello, it depends upon future situation also and the will comes into operation only after death of will maker. Ensure that your parent have updated nominations for the property in the housing society records. While a nominee is not the legal owner, it helps in the interim management of the property until the probate process is completed. OR If you dont want to get into technicality of probate then it is recommended to simplify the transfer process by having the property in joint names. If your parent include your and your sister's names as joint owners, the property can pass to the surviving joint owners without needing probate. OR For more safest option (to bypass from risk of toxicity in relationship with sister) I would recommend you to ask your parent for HIBA. Although HIBA does not require registration but it would be best if same is written on Non-judicial Stamp Paper, Notarised and Attested by 2 independent witnesses. This will ensure that if in future any dispute arises then you can have some more evidence in your favour. Thanks! Rajveer Singh Advocate",
            "There is no such deed. After demise of parents, you and your sister inherit 50% share each in parents property. than you can mutate the property on the basis of legal heir certificate.",
            "Dear Client, I am glad to learn that you are fully supportive of the plan and that your family has full support for it. Here are detailed answers to your questions to help simplify the process of estate transfer: First, regarding the registered will: In Mumbai, only a registered will can guarantee how your parents’ property is to be utilised due to the legal recognition of the will. Still, if ownership of a certain property, like a house in a society, is to be transferred, the will usually has to be probated. Probate, therefore, acts as the legal approval of the will and formal validation of the executor’s capacity to manage the estate. This can sometimes be viewed as a somewhat bureaucratic and lengthy process, but it helps to make certain that the will is fully legally binding, and it is a process that, if required, can be completed without any form of dispute. In this regard, it is wise to seek the services of an attorney to explain the probate procedures in Mumbai and any other associated issues. Second, if there are local provisions for what is called ‘ a transfer on death’, deed, your parents can consider making one, and through this, they could avoid probate court after their demise. It permits the property to be transferred to the beneficiaries through an assignment; hence, there is no need for the intervention of the probate court upon the owner’s death. consequently, they may consider establishing a trust. In this way, your parents can set terms on how the property should be split or turned over to you and your sister without the need for probate. A trust is an entity affiliated with a trustee; this would be responsible for the distribution of tangible and intangible assets as dictated by the terms of the trust deed. Ultimately, you and your sister can manage the property distribution without going through probate by entering into a family arrangement deed following the death of your parents. A mutual agreement among family members regarding the distribution of property is reflected in a family arrangement deed. By entering into this arrangement, the official probate process and its attendant costs may be avoided. To avoid future problems, it is imperative that the deed be well-drafted, unambiguous, and legally enforceable. In order to make sure that the family arrangement deed is enforceable and accurately represents the intentions of all parties, legal counsel should be sought out during its drafting and registration.",

        "full_text": "Transfer of immovable property after death. I am planning to buy a property, which is located in Bengaluru Karnataka, from a christian family (Mother, 2 sons and 1 daughter). Father has died intestate and the property is still in his name, but Khata has been transferred in the name of his Spouse. My questions are... 1. Do they have the authority to sell? 2. If yes, who can sell... since the property is still in the Deceased name? 3. Is it mandatory to have legal heir certificate? 4. Is Legal heir certificate same as \"Succession Certificate\"?",
        "answers": [
            "Yes. All three have to execute sale deed. Not but for safe transaction, ask for LHC. No.",
            "1. If it is confirmed taht they are the only surviving legal heirs to succeed to the estates of the deceased then they may have to execute a joint registered sale deed in favor of the prospective buyer. 2. They have to sell it jointly 3. It will establish the fact of the existing legal heirs which will facilitate to prevent anyone claiming a share in it as one of the legal heirs at a later stage. 4. No, that is different to succession certificate.",
            "Yes, the family has the authority to sell the property, but certain legal steps must be taken to ensure that the property transfer is valid and binding. Since the property is still in the deceased father's name, all legal heirs must be involved in the sale process. According to the Indian Succession Act, 1925, applicable to Christians, the property of a deceased person who dies intestate is inherited by the legal heirs. In this case, the legal heirs are the spouse (mother) and the children (two sons and one daughter). Therefore, all legal heirs (mother, two sons, and one daughter) must sign the sale deed to transfer the property legally. They all need to give their consent to the sale and participate in the execution of the sale deed. No, a legal heir certificate and a succession certificate are not the same, although they serve related purposes: Legal Heir Certificate: This certificate is issued by the local revenue authorities (like the Tehsildar) or the municipal authority, identifying the legal heirs of a deceased person. It is typically used for non-movable assets, such as property transfer, and for other purposes like claiming insurance, pension, or other benefits. Succession Certificate: This certificate is issued by a civil court and is used primarily for movable assets, such as bank accounts, securities, and debts. It authorizes the holder to collect the debts and securities of the deceased person. In your case, for the sale of immovable property, a legal heir certificate should suffice to establish the heirs of the deceased father. However, if there are any disputes or complexities, a succession certificate may be required. Hope your legal queries are answered to your satisfaction. Kindly give your rating please. Thanks!

After 10 days of sale and registration of the property in the new buyers name, an unknown person has filed a FIR against me and my sister u/s 420/406 alleging that we have knowingly sold the land 2nd time as the land was sold to him by my deceased father in 1983. He has made other false allegations of contacting us before the recent sale and informing us about his ownership on the same land. We have never met the person nor heard of his name earlier. In the FIR the person has not mentioned any Deed no. even though he claimed that he has a Deed confirming his ownership.

Pay attention to the aforementioned passages (420–406) and to the information about the unidentified individual and his/her accusations. Untrue Statements: This is especially important if you have never met this person and were never in a position to refute or corroborate their stories. Property Records: First action: attain the records of the original land grants. To prove auditor’s ownership and authenticity of the most recent transaction, this document is vital. Ensure the validity of the deed that is being produced by the unidentified person is as genuine as they are portraying it to be. This must have made a lot of sense to be legally sound if he failed to register the claim. Title Examination: Documents: All one needs to do is to look at the particular Records Sp Slim lt LR in detail. For your information that after the recent transaction your both names appear as owners in the following. Status of Mutation: Check if the transfer has been completed for the new buyer’s name. The fact is they may be in a significant disadvantage and weakened by lack of mutation in the case of the unknown individual. Moreover, what one can do is that to remove the FIR from its place and time. Upon issuance of the FIR, one may approach the High Court and request for the quashing of the FIR. It is your petitioner’s duty to prove that the FIR was falsely made and the intention was to cause trouble rather than to seek justice. Evidence Gathering: Pull an alibi. They include any form of record that would show that you had no information of the unidentified person’s claim, correspondence (log books, letters), and sale records. Observe Notification: Ensure you reply to the notification ref from the police station as soon as you can. As important, ensure that you bring the deed that was signed at the time of purchase and any other relevant documents.",

Besides he is stating that it was sold to him around 4 decades ago, what about the sale deed in his favor, whether the property was in his possession, if not then why did he not claim possession after purchasing it?

It’s important to ensure that all legal documents reflect the name change or alias usage to avoid complications. For passports, the official name without the alias is typically printed. However, if there has been a legal name change, supporting documents can be provided to update the passport accordingly. Given the complexity of legal and bureaucratic processes, it’s always best to consult with a legal professional who can provide specific guidance based on the laws and regulations applicable to your situation. They can assist you in ensuring that all documents are correctly aligned and legally recognised, which is essential for school admissions, travel, and other official purposes.",

            "Hello,",
            "1. There is no criteria to determine minimum or maximum maintenance for child support as it majorly depends on factors like - * Earning of parents *Standard of living of parties *Expenses of child which differs from case to case. 2. In a case where a lumpsum amount is demanded, a future prospect of expenses of child (for atleast 10 year) must be considered. For example if your wife is asking for 20L rupees and if we break down the sum 20L into 10 years 20L ÷10 = 2L will be the maintenance per year and if we further break it into months 2L ÷12 = 16,666 rupees per month. So monthly maintenance of your child demand by your wife is approx 17000 rupees Which is considered to be a nominal amount for maintenance where both the parents are earning well. 3. If the gold items were given by your friends to your wife than it becomes sole property of your wife only and you can not claim it back as once a thing is given to a wife by anyone its become her stridhan and she has absolute right over it."

I have also offered compensation in lieu of my notice period but my management is not agreeing and asking me to serve the 3 months notice period. My new employer is okay in accepting me only with a resignation acceptance. So will it be okay to leave the company and join one. Is there any legal implication for that",
        "answers": [
            "It is at discretion of company to waive notice period and accept salary in lieu of notice period 2) your company may not give you relieving letter if you don’t serve notice period 3) better to serve the notice period as it would other wise affect your future career",

            "1. If the offer letter specifies three months' notice period on either side, then the Company has to accept your offer of compensation in lieu of shortfall of notice period. 2. If you want Experience Certificate and Relieving letter from the Company, the Company may insist for you to serve for ninety days' in full. If you don't want Experience Certificate and/or Relieving letter, then you can leave the Company and join a new Company. 3. Since three months' notice period on either side is in the offer letter, there can't be any legal implication for that.",
            "If your present employer insists on your serving out the notice period in terms of the contract of employment, you have to comply. It is well within their discretion whether to accept your offer of salary in lieu of the remaining notice period, and you cannot legally challenge it. In the circumstances, talk to your would-be employer, explain your position convincingly, and seek two more months' time to join them. This is the safest exit route.",
            "If your employement agreement says specifically about serving a 90 days notice period than you are bound by such agreement and you have to serve such notice period. But if your employer agrees to relieve you for the compensation in lieu of your notice period than he can do so as per his wish."

After that, we don't have any communication for the past 2 weeks.

        "full_text": "How will property tax be charged on Jodi flats in Mumbai. Many developers are offering Jodi flats in Mumbai. Such flats are registered as two separate entities. Homebuyers purchase such under-construction flats with intention of combining them, even builder promise to do modifications (without any structural changes and any safety concerns). In such case- (1) Presently in Mumbai, flat with less than 500 Sq feet carpet area, property tax is exempted, but if combined area is more that 5oo sq feet, how BMC will charge Property tax for such individual units with less than 500 Sq feet carpet area? (2) It understands that Jodi flats (combined internally for better use) are legal if permission is taken from BMC by submitting revised plans during construction, or Permission from society is obtained (if society formed). It is expected that developer will obtain necessary approvals during constructions. Society may or may not give permission and it may be difficult to get BMC approval individually. In this regard, do developer clearly mention Jodi Flat in agreement with intended changes in plan? Any rule is there to safeguard buyers to make changes legally?",
        "answers": [
            "A Jodi flat, sometimes referred to as a \"combined\" or \"paired\" flat, is a residential unit that combines two or more adjacent apartments into a single living space. Jodi flats, as the name suggests, are a distinctive housing option where two adjacent apartments are merged to create a more expansive and unified living space. However, though the two flats are merged, property tax etc will be charged by the authorities on both apartments, depending on the size of the apartments. \"In simple words, merging of two flats is possible and it is legally permissible. However, who needs to go and seek permission from the BMC depending on project to project. In case, it is a new project and the home buyer is going to move into a jodi apartment, the home buyer should ask the developer to take all the permission. If it is an old society, the homeowner will require a no objection certificate (NOC) from the housing society. If the society is not formed, an NOC might be required from the developer. Additionally, a certificate from the structural auditor that the merging of two or more flats will not affect the structural stability of the building is needed.\"",
            "Dear client, as jodi flats are considered as a single individual unit, if they are above 500 Sq. feet combined then the municipal corporation can levy property tax. If the plan stipulates the flats as 2 units then it will be taxed accordingly. When building jodi flats, homebuyers should request that the developer obtain all necessary permissions before requesting an occupancy certificate (OC). Otherwise, he will have to seek these on his own after receiving the OC. However, if it is an old society, the homeowner must obtain a no objection certificate (NOC) from the housing society. If the society does not form, the developer will be required to provide a NOC. A certificate from a licenced structural engineer stating that the merger of two or more flats will not have an impact on the building's structural stability will also be required. One can mention in the agreement regarding the jodi flats and the agreements are governed by Contracts law and RERA act.",
            "It will be charged on individual flats",
            "You will be charged property tax for each flat separately if as per sanctioned plans they are shown as 2 separate flats 2) society may give permission for joining 2 flats but you will have to pay separate property taxes ,maintenance for each flat if as per plans they are shown as 2 flats",
            "- If the building sanctioned Plan is showing two flats , then you will have to pay property taxes for two units and even the maintenance of the society. - However, if the builder is ready to give Jodi flats , then after entering into contact with the builder , you can apply before the BMC for getting permission of the same , and to consider the jodi flats as one unit."

To seek custody, if you are hindu, you can move an petition under section 26 of Hindu Marriage Act, or Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, and in case to inter-religious marriage one can seek custody under section 38 of Special Marriage Act before your juridical family court. 2.

The opinion of a child who is over nine years old will be considered, and hence being mother of baby child, she is presently entitled for custody. - Further, all the ornaments are stridhan of your wife, because section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act, makes a female Hindu an absolute owner of Stridhan and gift received at the time of marriage., and hence you cannot claim the jewelry if given at the time of marriage to her. - However, your mother can file a complaint against her for the harassment caused her due to not allow her to see the child ."

Try for a family counseling with responsible mediation if you really want her back. In many cases, people won't check their faults but point the spouse. Just to avoid such a mistake, check if you have to change your behavior or your parents have to change their behaviors towards her, if she complains that she's not being treated properly.

The facts that you mentioned may not be the basis to deny restitution of conjugal rights but she may level false allegations of torture for dowry or mental harassment. it is recommended that you try to talk it out but if you do take the matter to court you can use the following judgement : Rudra Narayan Ray v. Piyali Ray Chatterjee. The Hon'ble Jharkhand High Court in this case stated that it is obligatory for women to serve their elderly mother-in-laws. The court further stated that the woman cannot put pressure on her husband or make any \"unreasonable demand to live separately\" in accordance with Indian culture. Thus if we keep in view just the above facts, you may file for restitution and she wouldn't be able to take the defence you mentioned above as fights are part and parcel of marriage and in the heat of the moment several things are said which are not meant.

Applied for divorce (HMOP) last year, Sep 2023 at family court which is ongoing and then I left the city with kids to hometown. Wife filed for HCP at high court in Dec 2023 and got interim visitation order which both parties complied. Later HCP was disposed in April 2024 with a final order directing the father (myself) to keep children in custody and show the kids to mother every month once which is a 500 kms away. Though she can visit the kids at anytime, but she's not interested in traveling long but the final court order has directed me that I should travel along with kids for visitation. Also the order states that both parties are at liberty to go to appropriate court for child custody/visitation. I don't know how long this visitation order is valid for if she don't go for GWOP option. Can I file GWOP at my district family court to stay the HC order or to avoid contempt case by my wife if in case she files if I'm unable to go for visitation?

I have sponsored my husband for Canadian PR & now he is an Indian citizen & holds valid canadian PR. At the time of marriage my husband & I had a clear understanding that as I am already settled abroad, I won’t move back. We got married with an understanding that he is looking to move to Canada once his PR comes & based on this understanding I sponsored him for canadian permanent residency. Now as he has received PR & has done soft landing, he is saying he doesn’t want to move as his parents are older & they need him. He never expressed such intentions during the due course of our marriage in the past 2 years ( while his file was under processing & even after her got COPR, confirmation of PR). He technically now is an Indian citizen holding PR status in Canada. My question: Can a state bank of india employee hold indian citizenship as well as canadian PR at the same time while still working at the bank in India? He wants me to move to India permanently citing his parents as reason. I sort of feel cheated as he had ample time to mull over his decision of getting married considering his parents are getting older & he has a secure bank job. Now the same reasons he had agreed to before, he is backing out on those. He never uttered a word for his plans otherwise while his PR file was being processed & even after landing & spending time in Canada. It’s only when he went back & I started asking questions that how is it going to work in the long distance like this & how about his canadian pr and all, he is saying he doesn’t need the pr anymore & wants me to move back. Is there something that i can do about it? He got married giving the impression that he will move. made me sponsor him, got PR & now says doesn’t want it anymore & wants me to move back. We are thinking of getting separated but I feel he took advantage of the whole situation. Conveniently said yes back then & conveniently just saying no now.

On the 16th day, he demanded our KYC & Property Documents to process the sale deed, which we refused to provide as the sale agreement was supposed to be signed before the sale Deed along with the agreed advance amount On the 26th day, after regular follow he stated that he was unaware that a sale agreement and a sale deed are two different things. On the 52nd day, after discussion and coming to a consensus on the clauses of the agreement, it was mutually decided to sign the agreement after Holi as it is considered an unauspicious period. In the meantime, the buyer was supposed to have the sale agreement ready for signatures. On the 62nd Day, we came to know that the agreement was still in draft mode On the 72nd Day – they asked for some more time stating that the agreement was ready but he was awaiting for funds. on the 91st Day - as there was no sign of agreement from the last 90 days we contacted the broker to look into this & he arranged an updated copy of the agreement, which was completely different from the one we had discussed at the beginning of the deal. The copy of the Sale Agreement stated that all liabilities were to be paid and cleared before \"EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT\" & \"BEFORE SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT\" in place of the Sale Deed / final registry.The changed terms mean we need to clear our Home loan, and property tax & hand over the possession of the flat before signing the sale agreement itself. We asked them to replace these words with \"BEFORE REGISTRY\" OR \"SALE DEED\", which he refused by stating \"execution of this agreement\" means after registry only.\" & he wanted to cancel this deal and refund his advance amount or else he will take this matter to court if we don't agree on these words. As this is a self-occupied property that we had to vacate, we had finalized to buy another house property and have committed to the other party. With this backing out of the buyer, it has put me under immense financial stress. Also, we had held the property for more than 100 days with a token amount of mere 51000/- in good faith and had foregone other prospective buyers. Can anyone suggest whether the buyer is legally eligible for Refund & Our Rights",
        "answers": [
            "1) it is difficult to prove oral agreement 2) if there is forfeiture clause then only you can forfeit the advance amount 3) you can file suit for specific performance to direct buyer to pay balance amount 4) express your willingness that execute registered sale deed",
            "Dear client, you can file a case in the court for specific performance from the buyer. You can also claim damages from his delay and causing mental agony.",
            "There was no formal agreement to sell entered between you both hence you cannot claim that you had kept the property on hold. Once you saw that the buyer is delaying the process unnecessarily, you could have informed about it and looked for some other buyer. In the absence of any agreement between you both, it would be illegal for you to deny the refund the payment of advance amount received by you. At the maximum you can deduct 10% of the amount towards waiting period and administrative costs. Your conditions to sell the property is practically not feasible because no buyer would be willing to wait for three months to take physical possession of the house property after paying full sale consideration amount getting the property registered on his name. At least you should have agreed to pay three months rent for the property after having sold it to the buyer which can justify or make some sense. You cannot thrust your liabilities on the buyer and the buyer is not obliged to accept them. Obtaining a token amount will not construe as a sale agreement hence you cannot approach court for any relief. If you want to avoid legal disputes, you can settle the matter amicably.",
            "The buyer is not right As per the original contract he was required to make an advance payment of 10% using which you were to clear the taxes and home loan dues All of this was agreed to be done prior to registration of sale deed The draft sale agreement sent by buyer with altered terms are not binding on you Even if no agreement is yet signed between you and the buyer you can still sue him for sticking to the original contract As per law a verbal contract can also be enforced by filing a suit for specific performance But filing a suit will unnecessarily lock your property in dispute which will slim your chances of getting new buyers If you forfeit his 51k, that will also lead to a dispute So my suggestion is, considering how courts function and how it takes time for matters to be finally resolved and adjudicated by court, it will be in your best interest that you refund his advance and look for new buyers rather than spending on litigation",
            "If you had agreement to sale ir any written communication you can file suit and recover any loss occurred to you. You can also forfeit the token amount"

        "answers": [
            "Trail of paper work will require for valid transfer start with deed for declaring a transfer along with all assets and liability. Your experience will carry forward in the firm being one of the partners. You can contact for the same.",
            "Your credentials and experience of many years can be used by newly formed partnership firm wherein you are one of the partners of the firm to participate in tenders 2) the said requirement regarding experience cannot be construed to mean that the said experience should be of the tenderer in his name only. It is possible to visualise a situation where a person having past experience has entered into a partnership and the tender has been submitted in the name of the partnership firm which may not have any past experience in its own name. That does not mean that the earlier experience of one of the partners of the firm cannot be taken into consideration. 3) New Horizons Ltd. v. Union of India, (1995) 1 SCC 478, tthe Supreme Court indicated the correct approach in interpreting terms of an invitation to tender, to the following effect: W.P.(C) 1712/2017 Page 6of 20 \"the requirement regarding experience does not mean that the offer of the original company must be considered because it has experience in its name though it does not have experienced persons with it and ignore the offer of the new company because it does not have experience in its name though it has persons having experience in the field. While considering the requirement regarding experience it has to be borne in mind that the said requirement is contained in a document inviting offers for a commercial transaction. The terms and conditions of such a document have to be construed from the standpoint of a prudent businessman. When a businessman enters into a contract whereunder some work is to be performed he seeks to assure himself about the credentials of the person who is to be entrusted with the performance of the work. Such credentials are to be examined from a commercial point of view which means that if the contract is to be entered with a company he will look into the background of the company and the persons who are in control of the same and their capacity to execute the work. He would go not by the name of the company but by the persons behind the company.\" 4) rely upon SC judgment cited herein above",
            "1) sole proprietorship should stop carrying on business 2) partnership deed should mention that the sole proprietorship's business was entirely subsumed or taken over by the partnership firm it should mention that that goodwill was parted; and separate consideration paid",
            "It depends upon terms and conditions of tender you can take the plea that one of the partners has extensive experience in same field ,had turnover of d crores that his sole proprietorship was conveyed unto partnership firm 3) NEW HORIZONS LTD. Vs. RESPONDENT: UNION OF INDIA DATE OF JUDGMENT09/11/1994 BENCH: AGRAWAL, S.C. (J) BENCH: AGRAWAL, S.C. (J) MUKHERJEE M.K. (J) CITATION: 1995 SCC (1) 478 ACT:",
            "Drafting of the Partnership Deed would be the first step in conversion of a sole proprietorship into a partnership firm. The major inclusion in the deed must be the declaration about the sole proprietorship which is being converted into a partnership by adding more partners and bringing in investment. The deed must also state the details of all the changes expected to occur with the introduction of the new business partners. After this, transfer all assets and liabilities into partnership firms as sale of business by proprietor to partnership firm. Experience gained from erstwhile proprietorship firm could not be construed as experience of partners in an individual capacity if applied independently without the partners in any tender. In a judgment of Supreme Court in New Horizons Ltd. v. Union of India, (1995) 1 SCC 478, wherein it was held that in the absence of any exclusionary clause in the tender document, it could not be said that past experience of a partner of the firm could not be considered. The Bench opined that coercing a tender inviting authority to blindly treat experience in the name of an erstwhile partnership firm as the experience of the partner in his individual capacity, would militate against every judicious consideration. This applies to proprietorship firm too."

Index 2 does not make the mother owner of the new flat. In any event the paaa was registered in her favor as a provisional member and trustee of other heirs (in this case the other heir is the son). The stamp duty on the transfer deed is nominal Rs. 500 plus registration fee. Release deed can also be made. There is no bar against it. The son is entitled to 50% estate of the deceased. So he can very well release his 50% share in favor of his mother. The registrar's refusal to register such release deed is outright illegal. He has no such statutory powers. He has no business to look into the title of the releasor son.",

The evidence supporting my assertion stems from their deceit; we discovered the girl was not residing at her parents' house but elsewhere. Despite her communication with me, she never disclosed the truth about her whereabouts. When my mother visited her parents' house to inquire about her well-being, they falsely claimed she had gone for a walk but her location on the mobile i gave to her showed she was in different location. Additionally, the girl was caught lying by sending me three-year-old photos from the internet, when i asked about her whereabouts.

However, as a matter of abundant caution, one can approach the Indian Court to declare that divorce is valid and binding. Foreign orders/decrees/judgments cannot be directly executed in India unless they are the judgments of courts in \"reciprocating territories\". In all other cases, the only mode of giving effect to a foreign judgment is to file a suit on the judgment in an appropriate Indian court, which has to be tested by section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code. If the full and final settlement agreement is signed by both parties in mediation, then both parties are bound to obey the decree. But in India, the decree from the US court can be used as a document in evidence side. The US court has no right to decide on property situated in India in between marital disputes. You can challenge this in India. In the eyes of the Indian judicial system, the property belongs to the person in whose name it's registered. If the property is in the name of the husband then the wife has no right on that property. As per Indian law, a husband cannot claim rights on wife’s property. A wife cannot claim a share in the property of her husband during his lifetime. During his lifetime, a wife during her marriage is in existence, or even if her marriage gets dissolved by decree of divorce, she has only the right to residence on certain terms and conditions, to be provided by her husband. 2. In case it is not possible and Judge signs the decree, what course of action I will have in India and where to approach? Do you have any plans to visit the US and stay there ? In such a case you will act otherwise forget about the US court procedure. Legal challenges against US court decisions are permitted under Indian law. US is considered as a Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India. An award from a ‘Non-Reciprocating Territory’ of India, a fresh suit in an Indian court with appropriate jurisdiction, needs to be instituted. No doubt that Foreign Judgments from Non-Reciprocating Territories need to pass through the sieve of Indian Judiciary but the sieve used is broad and spacious enough to allow the sink in of ‘the cause of Justice’ upheld by the courts of Foreign Countries."

In that case there is no need to exhaust the alternate remedies before approaching the HC. So writ petition is the appropriate remedy for you For now make a written application to the sub registrar to register the document and if he refuses then ask him to state his reasons in writing If after a reasonable period of you submitting the written application, the sub registrar does not give a written response then you can file the writ petition",

I intend to take home loan and purchase the house immediately. 5] After the land sale in the next 2-3 months, I will pre-pay the home loan and close it. Queries : a] Will I be eligible to save on capital gains on the money from land sale if I use it to close my Home Loan ? b] Please advise how I can go about purchasing the house immediately, sell the land later without capital gains implications ? Thankyou",

            "1) you can purchase the house by taking home loan 2) ) you must purchase the house within 1 year before the date of land sale or within 2 years after the sale. 3) There is no provision for tax exemption for LTCG if you repay the home loan taken for a residential house. However, you will be able to claim deduction under Section 80C in respect of the home loan repaid during the year along with other eligible items upto Rs. 1.50 lakh. 4) you can claim an exemption under Section 54EC by investing the indexed long-term capital gains in capital gains bonds of specified financial institutions within six months from the date of sale of the existing property These bonds have a tenure of five years and interest received on these bonds is fully taxable. You can plan to repay the home loan after the completion of the five-year tenure of the bond",
            "In my view s.54 of the income tax act providing for exemption from capital gains tax should be interpreted in a liberal manner so the source of money for purchase of the new property is not relevant in my view thus if the new property is purchased using funds made available through a home loan which would later on be foreclosed using the capital gains accrued on sale of the existing property, that would still qualify for exemption u/s 54 and you should get the benefit of that section what is important is that the capital gains on sale of old property must be used for purchase of the new property when you take a bank loan, you only have to put a down payment [usually 20%] from your pocket and the rest would be financed by the lender/bank so when that loan is repaid using the capital gains, it is like putting money for purchase of the new property which is what s.54 requires for claiming benefit of exemption so in my view you can go ahead with the course as stated in your query with the only caveat that you must foreclose the loan within the statutory period permitted to purchase the new property u/s 54 for claiming exemption from payment of capital gains tax",
            "- Under the Income Tax Act, property is regarded as a capital asset and any gains arising from its sale is taxable as Capital Gains. - Further, if the property is held for less than three years prior to its sale, it is termed as a short-term capital asset and any gain arising from the sale is treated as a short-term capital gain. - Further, if the property is sold after a holding period of more than three years, it is to be treated as a long-term capital asset and a gain arising from its sale is assessed as long-term capital gains - Further, as per Section 54 & 54 F of the Income Tax Act, you can re-invest the long term capital gains amount in residential house property and claim an exemption therein. - Further , no tax shall be paid , if you use the entire gain to buy another house within 2 years from the selling of your old property . - Since, you want to purchase the said property within this period then you can save tax, and even can use the amount to adjust the loan amount",

A maximum limit of Rs 10 crore has also been fixed for this exemption on LTCG tax. However, the purchase of a new residential property must be made within one year of the sale of the old property. The LTCG being used to repay the home loan is considered to be fulfilling the criteria set under Section 54 and Section 54F, and thus you are permitted to claim an exemption on the entire LTCG amount. For sale of agricultural land: Tax Exemption under Section 54B This exemption is only available on capital gains from a sale of land for an agricultural purpose outside of a rural area. The following conditions should be met to avail exemption on capital gain tax on property in India – In case there is a delay in investment, the individual can deposit the same amount in the bank for the exemptions as a long-term capital gain. The investment needs to take place within 2 years or else it will be accounted as short-term capital gain in the year of the expiry of the same.

If it's not currently zoned for commercial activities, you may need to apply for a zoning change or variance. Since you'll be making modifications to your existing structure, such as installing roof shades and ensuring proper ventilation, you'll likely need a building permit. This permit ensures that the modifications comply with local building codes and regulations. Depending on your location, there may be specific health and safety regulations that apply to event venues. This could include requirements for fire safety, accessibility for people with disabilities, food handling facilities, restroom facilities, etc. You'll need to ensure that your property meets all relevant health and safety standards.

Changing zoning requires approval, often involving public hearings and justification for the commercial benefit. Building codes: Commercial properties have stricter safety and accessibility codes than residential ones. Your existing property might need renovations to comply. Permits and licenses: You'll need specific permits and licenses for the intended commercial activity. DC conversion usually refers to converting agricultural land to non-agricultural use. Charges for such conversion vary significantly depending on location, land size, intended use, and relevant government policies. It's best to consult with local authorities for specific details.",

Regarding your question about the EC for the specific apartment, it's common for such documents to not be available until the apartments are individually registered. In the absence of an apartment-specific EC, a document on the builder's letterhead confirming that the apartment has not been sold to anyone else and that you are the first buyer can indeed serve as additional proof of ownership. However, it's essential to ensure that the letter from the builder includes all relevant details, such as the apartment number, building name, survey number, and any other identifying information. This letter should also be duly signed and stamped by the builder for authenticity. Overall, while the absence of an apartment-specific EC might seem like a gap, the builder's letter can serve as a valid interim solution until such documentation becomes available."

            "Dear Client, Both parents typically have equal rights when it comes to making decisions about their child's education, unless otherwise specified by a court order. If your sister and her husband have not gone through a legal separation or divorce process, the husband may still have legal rights regarding the child's education. Schools often require documentation such as a birth certificate and sometimes proof of guardianship or custody. If your sister is the legal guardian of her daughter or has sole custody, she should be able to provide documentation to support this. While it's ideal to involve both parents in a child's education, if the father is not taking responsibility and your sister has legal custody or guardianship, she may be able to enroll her daughter in school without his involvement. However, this could potentially lead to legal complications if the father disagrees or challenges the decision. Whether or not to include the father's name on the admission form depends on the school's requirements and the legal situation. If the father's name is required, your sister may need to provide it, even if he is not involved in the child's life or education.",
            "In most cases in India, a father's consent is not mandatory for enrolling a child in school, especially under the circumstances you described. Here's what you can do: Your sister can likely enroll her daughter in school without her husband's consent. Supreme Court judgements have allowed single parents or mothers with custody to make such decisions. Use your sister's name and details on the admission form. For the photos, a single photo of your sister with the child might suffice. Explain the situation to the school administration if they insist on both parents' photos. Regards.

        "full_text": "Seeking guidance on GWOP case filed in husband's home state. I've been married to my husband for 13 years. We're Muslims, he's from Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh, and I'm from Hyderabad, Telangana. We have two daughters, aged 13 and 3. Since our marriage, my husband has been working in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, while we lived there and the children studied. During vacations, we visit India, staying in Anantapur (his family's place) and Hyderabad (my mother's home). Unfortunately, my husband and in-laws have been abusive, leading me to file a 498A complaint at a Hyderabad police station a year ago. Now, for about a year, both kids have been living with me and attending school in Hyderabad. Their Aadhar and passport addresses are registered in Hyderabad. Recently, my husband filed an RCR (Restitution of Conjugal Rights) and GWOP (Guardianship and Wards of Minor) case in Andhra Pradesh, his home state. I'm unsure if such a GWOP case filed in his hometown is maintainable. Upon receiving the summons for the GWOP case, we hired a local lawyer. We skipped 4 summons, and yet to file a counter. Our lawyer is been urging us to travel to Anantapur and present the children in court. However, the prospect of traveling such a distance with the kids just for a court appearance is daunting and seems like a tactic to further harass us. I'm seeking advice on how to handle this situation more effectively.",
        "answers": [
            "Object to jurisdiction of GWOP in Anantpur 2) since kids are residing in Hyderabad case should have been filed in Hyderabad only 3) file detailed reply in RCR case that you cannot stay with husband as he has harassed you and abused you and 498 A case is pending against him and in laws 4) you can file petition in SC for transfer of the 2 cases to Hyderabad",
            "Presence in court is not required the case can be filed with POA",

            "If you had filed 498A case in Hyderabad a year ago, than kindly ask Anantpur court to transfer those RCR and GWOP cases in Hyderabad court. By giving reason that you couldn't travel by taking kids to Anantpur. It's better to have all cases in one court as you have filed case first in the Hyderabad.",
            "Dear Client, It's understandable that traveling to Anantapur for court appearances might be challenging, it's important to respond to the summons and participate in the legal proceedings. Failure to respond could have negative consequences for your case. However, you should discuss your concerns with your lawyer and explore alternative options, such as requesting remote participation or seeking a postponement if travel is not feasible. If you disagree with the claims made in your husband's petition for restitution of conjugal rights or guardianship and wards of minor, you should file a counter affidavit stating your objections and present your side. If you feel that you or your children are at risk of harm from your husband or his family, consider seeking legal protection orders such as a restraining order or protection order. If custody of your children is at issue in the guardianship and wards of minor case, be prepared to present evidence of your ability to care for and provide for your children's best interests."

This property is in joint name of Myself and my father. My father is 80+ and has only 2 children -me and an elder sister married and settled in a diff city. I want to make a Will for my father so that I can get 100% of his share of the property so that I have exclusive rights to this property after him. Both Father and Sister ready for this and even asking me to do this soon as my father is ageing. Now My qs: If I make a registered will(that is Will is made and executed in office of Registrar, then after my father, will the whole right of father in property I will get and I'll have no problem selling it later? I don't want to go for gift deed since it will attract a huge amount of Stamp duty. What if I make a simple will and not execute it? (Also can registrar come to home to execute the Will citing old age of my father?) 2. We have a shop in my Mother's name and she is no more. How to manage this one? Shall I try to sell it during the lifetime of my father and if I try to sell it later after him, will that be more of an issue? 3. My father has some FDs in his bank account which I use online as he can't. Do I need to make a will for that too? Thanks",

Hence for now your father and sister can execute a registered release deed relinquishing their rights in the property in your favour, after which you will become an absolute owner of the shop. 3.

There will be no problem in future for you to sell the apartment single-handedly. Normally stamp duty for Gift Deed amongst blood relatives will be normal as in Karnataka around Rs. 7500/-. Private Attendance of the Sub Registrar can also be arranged wherein the Sub Registrar will visit the house of the Testator/Donor for executing WILL/Gift Deed. 2. Assuming that your mother died intestate ( without executing a WILL), her self acquired property (shop) would devolve equally to your father, your elder sister and you in 1/3rd proportion. Get the registered Relinquishment Deed executed by your father and your elder sister in your favour so that you can sell it alone. 3. Regarding FDs maintained by your father, it's he who has to execute the WILL in this regard and not you.",

Your father can simply sign on the Will in front of 2 witnesses 2. your mother appears to have died intestate. so you will have to file a petition in the high court for grant of letters of administration for dealing with and administering the properties of your late mother. you will not be able to sell her property without the LA from court 3. yes the FD's should also be included in the Will [assuming your father wants to make a bequest in respect of the said FDs too]",
            "it is necessary to apply for probate of will 2) The Supreme Court has said that mere registration of a Will would not be sufficient to prove its validity, as its lawful execution necessarily has to be proved in accordance with Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. 3) gift deed during father lifetime is better option"

            "Here are the options considering you want your principal amount back in full within 15 months, without any interest or profit: Options with Repayment Guarantee: Direct Loan with Promissory Note: This is a simpler option. You provide a loan of 5 lakh rupees to the Imam. However, unlike a traditional loan, you won't charge interest. A promissory note is a legal document signed by the Imam acknowledging the debt and promising repayment within a specific timeframe (15 months in this case). This document can be helpful if there's a need to enforce repayment through legal means, though it's best to avoid this scenario. Security Deposit: This option involves framing the 5 lakh rupees as a security deposit for the institute's proper establishment and adherence to your initial vision. A legal agreement would outline the terms of the deposit, including its purpose (starting the institute) and the repayment timeframe (15 months). Upon successful establishment and operation for 15 months, the 5 lakh rupees would be returned to you. Important Considerations: Legal Agreements: For both options above,, draft a watertight agreement that protects your interests and ensures the Imam understands the repayment obligations. Guarantor: Consider having a guarantor (another trusted person) co-sign the agreement. This provides an additional layer of security in case the Imam is unable to repay. Alternative Option with Risk Mitigation: Remember: While these options offer some safeguards, lending money always carries inherent risk. Carefully evaluate the Imam's credibility and his ability to repay within the timeframe. By discussing these options with the Imam , you can choose the approach that best balances your desire to support the institute with protecting your principal amount.

I am reaching out to seek your professional guidance and advice regarding a significant issue I've encountered with a franchisee agreement. In brief, I entered into a franchisee agreement with a Goa-based company in Ahmedabad to operate a multi-brand store specializing in two-wheeler electric vehicles. However, several complications have arisen throughout the course of this arrangement, and I find myself in a precarious situation. Firstly, the company, which does not manufacture vehicles directly but rather acts as a mediator with various brands, failed to adequately inform me of the legal requirements for selling vehicles. While I was under the impression that having a GST number was sufficient, it became apparent that RTO TC (Registration Transfer Certificate) was also necessary, a crucial detail that was omitted during our initial dealings. Moreover, the company's promises of ongoing support and training for staff were not fulfilled as expected. Training sessions were inadequate, and the quality of the supplied vehicle stock fell short of what was initially promised. Additionally, complications arose when attempting to obtain the necessary TC from the Gujarat RTO due to the nature of being a multi-brand store, ultimately resulting in rejection despite my best efforts and substantial financial investment. Subsequently, a customer who purchased a vehicle from my store faced significant delays in registration, leading to dissatisfaction and even physical altercations. Despite my repeated attempts to seek assistance from the company, their responses have been lacking, leaving me to navigate these complex issues alone. Furthermore, the company proposed an alternative income stream through a rental program with a third-party platform, which ultimately proved unsuccessful, leaving me burdened with additional financial strain and obligations. In light of these circumstances, I find myself in considerable debt and facing immense personal and professional stress. The company's refusal to assist in resolving these issues has only exacerbated the situation, leaving me at a loss for how to proceed. Additionally, I want to emphasize my intention to recover all losses incurred as a result of the company's actions. Starting this business involved taking out loans, and now I find myself unable to meet the financial obligations, including loan repayments. The situation has escalated to the point where I've had to seek additional loans from various sources to cover daily expenses. It's imperative that I explore all avenues to recover these losses and alleviate the financial strain imposed upon me. Given the complexity of the situation, I would greatly appreciate your expert advice on the best course of action moving forward.

Document any promises made, lack of support provided, and financial losses incurred as a result of the company's actions or inactions. This documentation will be crucial if you need to take legal action or negotiate a resolution. Despite the company's previous lack of assistance, continue to communicate with them in writing about your concerns and the issues you've encountered. Clearly outline the problems you've faced and the losses you've incurred. Request their cooperation in resolving the issues and recovering your losses. Many franchise agreements include clauses requiring disputes to be resolved through mediation or arbitration rather than litigation. If your agreement has such a clause, consider initiating mediation or arbitration proceedings to resolve the issues with the company in a more cost-effective and efficient manner. If the company has materially breached the franchise agreement or failed to provide the support and services promised, you may have grounds for termination or renegotiation of the agreement. Given your current financial strain, consider seeking assistance from financial advisors or debt counselors who can help you manage your debts, renegotiate loan terms, or explore options for debt relief. If the situation proves untenable and the company is unwilling to cooperate in resolving the issues, you may need to consider exiting the franchise agreement altogether."

        "full_text": "Succession of property of woman in islamic law. In Muslim law, if a woman has passed away intestate: 1. is her property completely Inherited by her daughters or does her brother have claim over any share as per sharia? if brother does have a claim, how much? 2. If post her death, the brother has executed sale of another property with her entire share going to her daughters, does this set irrevocable precedence for him not to have any claim in her share of other properties? or can he selectively claim share in other properties?",
        "answers": [
            "husband (in the case of succession to the wife's estate) takes a half share in a case where the couple is without lineal descendants, and a one-fourth share otherwise. A sole daughter takes a half share. Where the deceased has left behind more than one daughter, all daughters jointly take two-thirds.",
            "A sole daughter takes a half share. Where the deceased has left behind more than one daughter, all daughters jointly take two-thirds. 2) If both parents of the deceased are alive, they take 1/6th each and the remainder goes to sons and daughters as stated above. If only one parent is alive, she or he takes 1/6th and the remainder goes to them the same way. 3) if brother has sold one property then daughters have to file suit to set aside sale",
            "Under Muslim laws, non-testamentary succession is governed by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1973, Under Islamic laws, male and female heirs alike have the right to inherit property. Near female heirs or cognates are recognised in the class of heirs. However, the females get only half of the quantum shares allotted to their male counterparts The heirs of a deceased Muslim fall under the following classes – The sharers fall under class I heirs, and there are 12 relatives of the deceased on the list of sharers. But there is a certain exception to the rights of husband and wife – the estate of the deceased devolves to the blood relations equally, and the females are allowed only half of the share of the males in each class. Therefore, there is no hierarchy with respect to who inherits the estate first between the descendants, ascendents, and collaterals, as they all inherit side by side.",
            "1. The law of succession applies hence her sons are also entitled to a share as per law. 2. The daughters can claim their share in the property as a right and can file a suit for partition 1. The law of succession applies hence her sons are also entitled to a share as per law. 2. The daughters can claim their share in the property as a right and can file a suit for partition",
            "Dear Client, In Islamic law, inheritance distribution is governed by the rules outlined in the Quran and Hadith. Here's how it typically works in the scenarios you've described: Inheritance Distribution of a Woman who has passed away intestate: If a woman dies intestate (without leaving a will), her estate will be distributed according to the rules of Sharia. In the absence of a husband, sons, or father, her daughters are entitled to a share of her estate. The daughters collectively inherit a fixed portion, usually two-thirds of the deceased woman's estate if she has children. However, this share may vary depending on specific circumstances and local interpretations of Islamic law. As for the brother, he is entitled to a share of the estate if there are no other male heirs (sons, father, husband). The brother's share would generally be half of what each daughter inherits. However, if there are other male heirs, such as sons, the brother's share may be reduced or eliminated entirely. Effect of Brother's Execution of Sale on Inheritance: If the brother has already executed the sale of a property with the entire share going to the daughters, it establishes a precedent for his acknowledgment and relinquishment of his right to inherit from that specific property. However, this action does not necessarily extend to other properties owned by the deceased woman. The brother may still have a claim to inheritance from other properties unless he explicitly waives his right or there are other legal considerations that prevent him from claiming a share. Regarding inheritance in the case of a divorced woman, the general principles of inheritance apply similarly. However, the specifics may vary depending on whether the woman has children, parents, siblings, or other relatives who are eligible heirs according to Islamic law. Inheritance laws can be complex and may vary based on cultural, regional, and legal interpretations."

My question is how much time will take us to separate ? We are thinking of getting divorce amicably. But one lawyer said this process will take at least 2 years !! But we are wondering if there is chance we might get annulment, if we go via mental cruelty route ? The same lawyer said it will still take 2 years... She had bipolar/borderline disorder . I knew of this, but had no idea of severity of her mental condition. Those 25 days were torture for me. She also had other issues that she hid from me. I ignored all those.. but they eroded my trust. We never had sex. I was under a lot of stress, half our days were spent fighting, she also had hygiene issues. But mostly it was her paranoia/anger issues. Towards the end She wrote a whatsapp message to my family accusing me being impotent. I had gotten tests, met Dr, who said I was potent. I also did ejaculate several times on her body as well. She also wrote other things that were false, like that I never got intimate, I have proof of this being false. videos, her own words etc. Also several whatsapp chat examples of her being 'cruel' In another mail, she also wrote a a scathing criticism of my mother. It was very silly. My mother didn't do anything wrong, not even a tiny thing. The letter only contained text like \"your mother must be happy to see us fight\" . \"she didn't smile, when I praised her\" etc. Also have a letter where she was sort of confessing \" I am cruel, I am a criminal\" etc. Should we go for 'mental cruelty' or amicable divorce ?

For a decree of nullity, it is essential to prove that the ailment rendered the respondent incapable of marriage and the procreation of children. Whereas in your case she was very well capable of marriage hence you have no chance to file an annulment petition on this ground. However as per to the Section 13 of the Act, divorce or judicial separation can be obtained if the person has been “incurably of unsound mind,” or has been suffering continuously or intermittently from “mental disorder of such a kind and to such an extent that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent. As your marriage is not completed one year yet, you can file a petition under section 10 of the HMA for judicial separation which can subsequently be converted to divorce after one year, so that you can get the relief of living separately away from her without being subjected to the acts of cruelty from her side."

        "full_text": "Actual selling price vs stamp duty price of rural agriculture property. Hi There I am hoping someone can help me in this area of law. I fully understand the capital gains rules for rural agriculture land as well as that fact that it is \"legally\" allowed to sell property above stamp duty value and sale should always be registered at actual sale price and transaction done via bank only. That is what book says and I am aware of that. May question however is based on what actually happens on the ground in Govt registrar offices. I am told Registrars / Tehsildars do not allow sellers / buyers to register a sale above stamp duty, hence seller is forced to receive difference between stamp duty value and actual sale price in cash. I am told registrars enforce this as registering one sale on higher price will mean they will face issues when they register any adjoining lands at lower price (stamp duty value). As most people do not want to pay higher tax, everyone forced to transact in cash component to cover the differences. Question is, as a seller how can I declare that cash component to keep my money in the white? If my buyer has all the money (fully market value) in white, can I get full amount via bank transaction instead of cash and what will be tax implications for both of us?",
        "answers": [
            "You can insist that actual sale consideration be mentioned in sale deed pay stamp duty on market value mentioned in sale deed and not the circle rate don’t pay any amount in cash you are aware that payment by cash of more than 2 lakhs is an offence under income tax and penalty equivalent to amount received by you can be levied under income tax act payer is not liable to pay penalty",
            "The situation what you have discussed here is not the law of the land, this may happen in some places and not everywhere. Assuming that an event similar to what you have described here, if you go by the advise received to receive the excess amount beyond the sale consideration amount through bank transaction itself, the amount received through bank cannot be denied hence you can show the excess amount as income from other sources, and you don't have to specify the other source in the ITR. Firstly you make sure that the registration of the property is executed by the buyer paying the actual, sale consideration amount shown in the sale deed which may be more than the government guidelines value, if the Sub-registrar is denying to register the property to the value higher than the government guidelines value, then you can approach the District registrar with a complaint against the sub-registrar and seek his direction to the sub registrar to register the same as per the value paid by the buyer which is the prevalent market price. If you do not want to take this trouble then you can think about the alternate option as suggested above.",
            "Dear Client, If you're receiving a cash component as part of the property transaction, it's crucial to declare this amount accurately to tax authorities. Failing to do so can lead to potential legal and tax consequences in the future. You should report this cash component as part of your income during the relevant tax year. This ensures that your income tax filings are in compliance with the law. Keep thorough documentation of the entire transaction, including any cash component received. This documentation should include the sale agreement, receipts, bank statements, and any other relevant paperwork. Having a clear paper trail can help support your case in case of any inquiries from tax authorities. Both you as the seller and the buyer need to consider the tax implications of the transaction. Sellers typically incur capital gains tax on the profit made from selling the property. If you receive a cash component, this amount would still be subject to capital gains tax. As for the buyer, they should be aware that paying a portion of the transaction in cash doesn't absolve them of their tax obligations. They should ensure that they have proper documentation for the entire transaction to avoid any legal issues. If both parties are willing, conducting the entire transaction through bank transactions can help ensure transparency and legality. However, this may require cooperation from all parties involved, including the registrar's office.",

Else you can obtain it from the sub-registrar's officer by applying for a certified copy it appears that the builder has not formed a society under the Maharashtra Societies Act and has instead formed a condominium under the Apartment Ownership act.

We did insist even before registration of the plot. We got same response. Finally in June 2023 registration was done and now two weeks back we decided to put fencing to our plot and the contractor confirmed the dimensions are way beyond less. Our actual dimensions in the Sale Deed and Khata is 2095 square feet and the actual size has turned out to be only 1486 squqrefeet. There is a total difference of 608 squqrefeet. The marketing team from developer side had insisted to register it only for the government value. But we brought it for market value full in white money and also paid the actual stamp duty and registration fees. We fell short of about 5 lakh rupees and we took a personal loan for registration.

The second floor is built by me from Bank loan which is duly settled. There is no Will of him as such just a mutual agreement dividing the of the house (g+1)among we four brothers. Now we wish to sell the house with consent off all the brothers. I have few questions in mind: 1. Do we have to get the house registered/ mutated in our name before selling? 2. If the answer is yes, then the seller has to give the compensation equally to the four brothers or there can be one us who decides to act as lead and divide the money after the sale based on some mutual agreement. Please advise the nature of the agreement. 3. From the perspective of saving the LTCG, is it legally possible to add our respective wife’s name also in the sale agreement so that each family can buy more than one home. 4. Since I have made the second floor,will the plot will also be divided in that proportion?",

            "No need. Just obtain legal heir certificate.",
            "1. As per law, after the demise of your father intestate , his property would be devolved upon all the legal heirs equally, hence you four are only legal heirs and mother is not alive , then you each having 1/4th share in the property left by your father. - You can apply before the Revenue officer for mutation of the property after submitting the death certificate of father and said executed mutual agreement 2. The the sale proceed amount will be distributed amongst all the legal heirs equally , and the purchaser may ask for signing the sale deed from all you four . - However, if anyone of you unable to go for registration , then he can execute a POA in favour of other . 3. They have no role in the property during the life time of their respective husband. 4. Since, your father was the owner of the G+1 , then this floor will come under the distribution , however you can ask for the expenditure of construction from all legal heirs equally.",
            "1. Registration in favor of the legal heirs of the deceased is not necessary, but if necessary you can get it mutated to all your names jointly in order to sell the property by executing a sale deed jointly in favor of the prospective buyer. 2. As the property has not been partitioned among all the legal heirs by a registered document, the mutually agreed division, if it was made by an unregistered deed, is not legally valid, besides the second floor was constructed by you without a permission or consent of your father or other legal heirs, hence if the others claim a share out of that floor also, you may have to move court to declare the title to your name based on the evidence, otherwise the sale consideration of that floor also shall have to eb divided among all the legal heirs, hence it is advisable that all the legal heirs may decide about sharing the sale consideration amount mutually in an amicable manner.. 3. LTCG is different from that of the exemption claimed, if you would like to invest the LTCG in your wife's property then you can claim exemption. Relief on capital gains tax is available when LTCG is reinvested in the name of the spouse. 4. Even though you constructed the second floor out of your own funds, but you do not own the land underneath, hence you cannot claim title to the property owned by your father. In the given situation if your cosharers claim a share in that property too, then you may have to amicably settle the issue instead of stretching it to legal solutions."

Hence if failed to acquire her share in the property during her lifetime then it will devolve on the other legal heirs of Ravi. However, the partition suit filed by daughter of Ravi clearly indicates the share of the mother and she has been duly impleaded as a party'to the suit, it is deemed that she acquired her share, in that circumstances, her share of property will devolve on her own legal heirs which will include Ravi's legal heirs too.",
            "1. Ravi's mother is independent to take any decision regarding her 1/3rd undivided share in the property. In other words, she can bequeath the property to anyone or to many persons by executing WILL, execute registered Gift Deed, Relinquish her share in favour of Ravi's son and/or daughter, execute settlement deed, etc. 2.

If Ravi's mother dies intestate, her other three sons would not get any share.",
            "In the given scenario, it appears that Ravi's mother, Ravi's son, and Ravi's daughter are the legal heirs of Ravi's estate, each with a 33% share. Since Ravi's properties are still in his name and have not been divided among the legal heirs, the following situations could arise: Ravi's Mother Writing a Will/Gift Deed: Ravi's mother, being one of the legal heirs, can potentially write a will or gift deed to transfer her 33% share of Ravi's properties to someone else. However, if the properties are not yet divided among the legal heirs, she can only bequeath or gift her share in those undivided properties. The rights of the other legal heirs (Ravi's son and daughter) to their respective 33% shares will remain intact. Ravi's Mother's Share Dissolving Among All Legal Heirs: If Ravi's mother passes away without leaving a will or gift deed, her 33% share in Ravi's properties would typically devolve according to the laws of intestate succession. In the case of Hindu family, if a person dies intestate (without a will), the distribution of their estate is governed by the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. According to the Hindu Succession Act, in the absence of a will or other testamentary disposition, Ravi's mother's 33% share would be divided equally among all her Class I legal heirs, which include her sons (Ravi and his brothers), and the distribution would be as follows: Ravi's Son (Ravi's grandson): 33% (initially his own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% each (assuming no other grandchildren) Ravi's Daughter (Ravi's granddaughter): 33% (initially her own 33% share) + 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 66% or 33% each Ravi's Brothers: Each would receive 33% (1/4th of Ravi's mother's 33% share) = 33% each Please note that the actual distribution of the estate would depend on the specific laws of intestate succession applicable in the relevant jurisdiction."

This includes trade licenses, GST registration, and any other permits required for operating a commercial establishment in Kolkata. The property tax you'll have to pay going forward would depend on the specific regulations of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC). KMC determines property tax based on factors like property size, type, usage, and location. Since you're converting your property into a commercial space, you'll likely be assessed at a different rate than before as follow: Developed Bustee is 8%, Government Properties under KMC Act, 1980 is 10%, Properties having Annual value of < 30000 is 15 % and others is 20%"

            "The properties inherited from their father by your father and his brother were duly partitioned and both have sold their properties at that time itself and both have settled at different places and living separately. Therefore the claim made by your uncle is no where legally valid. Your father acquired the properties from his father in law through a Will which has nothing to do with the family property. Your uncle's claim for partition or any share is not a legally valid or a rightful claim. It can be considered as an illegal claim. Your father need not give him anything, neither the court will entertain any claim made by your uncle in this regard."

My mother's gold was kept in my maternal uncle( mother's cousin) locker. We are 4 brothers 2 staying in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and 2 of us staying in Virar. My uncle called just 2 of them to their home and distributed the gold among them. He did not communicate ( in any form calls, email, zoom call, sms) with other 2 brothers and nor the brothers who received communicated that they are going for collection of this gold. One of my elder brother who is present in Mumbai at that time was also not called. I am working on overseas job at Dubai. Conditions are not very good due to heart attacks which got in year 2017. Now what I need to know how this can be solved, also father had some fixed deposits as he was pensioner from Indian Navy as retired office. Later pension was transferred to mother. Now since both are expired, we dont have any records of bank accounts controlled by my brother at the time of illness of my father and later my mother. No records of Deposit receipts, even the property of flat which is under recontruction in virar ( construction not yet started due to various reasons ), we dont see any documents from our brother, nor we have been give any will copy if so made,which we dont have any record. We have one property in father name at punjab our home town. The documents of that I have a scanned copy . Appreciate your reply how this all can be concluded in proper manner so that none of us are cheated. A quick reply will be appreciated as I am planning for visit to India.

Sale deed between former owner and us is there as well as society shares in our name however below miss outs: 1 – Name (actual, only initial, middle name and last name is proper) is different as on sale deed and society share certificate v/s municipality records (name is correct on both sale deed and society share certificate, mismatch is only on municipality records) 2 – Though we have bank pass book showing part cash deposited just few days prior to sale deed date (remaining was paid by grand parents that time and we don’t have passbook as well as grand parents are not alive) and cheque number subsequently however the debit entry for the amount on sale deed not there since pass book was not updated for some 1.5-2 years and bank official just put dash instead. Later cheque numbers are inline with what is on sale deed i.e. if sale deed has 1 and 2, we don’t have entry for 1 and 2 but we have 5, 6 in the passbook plus the fact we had cash deposited in bank just at the time of sale deed. 3- Out of 2 share certificates, one certificate number is incorrect on sale deed however share numbers mentioned are proper. Though we don’t have anyone putting objection since we are the only owner, however I need to know the procedure to register the sale deed with sub-registrar since it was not done since then. Also can it be done solely based on sale deed and society share certificate? Also how to correct name initial in municipality. The owner was mid aged back then (40 yrs back) and no connect of him with society as well as us thus presuming may not be alive and we are unaware of any of his whereabouts i.e. legal heirs. Also currently it is rented with proper stamp and registration of LnL agreement. Since very old property high chances of going for redevelopment, thus do we follow all this sale deed registration with sub-registrar and name change in municipality or only the sale deed with society share certificate in our name would be fine to get allotment in new housing without any issues? Plus what all charges do we have to pay in the entire procees? Plus anyway if current owner i.e. our father can pass on the property to us without going through all this above and we then later get it registered with Sub-registrar?

            "It appears that the registered Will was not enforced nor acted upon by the beneficiaries, even after three years after they became major by age. In the meantime, the mother and three sons alone sold the property in favor of some buyers after the death of the testator which indicates that nobody bothered abut the Will and the bequest made therein in this regard. If so, then the property can be considered as intestate succession, while so you being one of the legal heirs to your deceased father you can file a suit for claiming your share in the property with separate possession as a right. It is also a fact tht can be proved by documentary evidence that the brothers and mother sold the properties by totally excluding the daughter or her interests in the property. If your brothers submit the Will to the court, then the court will question their authority to sell the property that belonged to third party, hence they may avoid that situation. If at all the grandchildren are challenging the sale of property then the court may pass a verdict in their favor. The partition suit is not barred by limitation",

No, you have no right as the father purchased the property himself and this property will considered as self-acquired property and for that Land he made a Will in favor of the grand children hence you have no right over that property i.e., property 26 acres. 2. except 26 acres land, the properties sold by them without you are illegal and those sale deed can be cancelled by the Civil Court. 3. Consider opinion no.1. 4. those properties are related to grandchildren now after the execution of Will and death of your father. 5. What will be challenged? 6. The present owner related to 26 acres of property which was self-acquired property of your father who had executed a Will in favour of his grand children, those properties are safe and the present owner shall be legally owner of those properties but the sale deeds of those properties which were sold by them without your signature except that 26 acres, will be declare as null and void as you are also the share holder in the ancestral properties. 7. No, she cannot, but if she got the knowledge within three years only then she may. 8. From the date of knowledge. Feel Free to Call",

        "full_text": "Need help on how to negotiate apartment price with builder. Hello: I am planning to purchase an apartment in Bengaluru. I wanted to buy a 4 bhk house but such options are very limited. Hence I am planning to combine two 2-bhk houses into one 4-bhk duplex house. i have visited an under construction property at Elegant Hermitage in Bengaluru. Builder is quoting 1.1 crore for 2 BHK flat of 1260 sqft at the rate of INR 7000/sqft as per cost sheet. He may reduce by 2-3 lakhs if I speak to him. He is quoting INR 145 per sqft for water, STP, power backup and 3 lakh for car parking and 3.5 lakh for club house charges within that cost. GST, registration charges extra. I need help as to how I should negotiate the price if I want to buy two 2-BHK house and combine it into one 4 BHK duplex house. As per cost sheet builder is charging double the price for water, STP, power backup, care parking and club house charges for 4 BHK house. My overall budget to purchase this combined 4 BHK house is about 1.6-1.7 Crores. Need help to negotiate. Also if builder agrees, then will he charge for doing certain structural changes in the house i.e. for combining 2 houses etc., What should be my main points for price negotiation?",
        "answers": [
            "1. One of the points for price negotiation is since you are buying two numbers two BHK flats at the same time the builder is getting money for 2 Numbers Flats at the same time. 2. The negotiated final rate for buying two numbers flats should include structural changes for combining 2 houses, obtaining permission for the amalgamation of Khatha from BBMP.",
            "Frankly no builder is going to reduce the price of flat by 50 lakhs 2) only if builder is unable to sell the flats woukd he agree to drastic reduction 3) find out sale price of other flats in the complex and rate at which he has sold the flats 4) also price of flats in other complex near the area 5) local real estate agent will be best guide in this regard 6) builder will charge you for structural changes",
            "1. There is no special way for negotiation . 2. The law is silent about this and it solely depends upon the personal skill of the negotiator.",
            "There's no fixed policy or law to bring the builder to agree for your offer. It depends on negotiations and flexibility in both the sides. If the builder is not transparent and is likely to exploit your situation, you may reconsider your decision buy the apartment in this place.",
            "Here's how you can approach negotiating the price for your desired 4-BHK duplex apartment: Before Negotiation: Research: Check similar projects in the area and their pricing for 4-BHK duplexes. This will give you a benchmark for negotiation. Feasibility: Confirm with the builder if combining two 2-BHK flats into a 4-BHK duplex is structurally possible. Get this confirmation in writing. There might be limitations due to load-bearing walls etc. Negotiation Points: Bulk Purchase Discount: Highlight that you're purchasing two units, generating a larger sale for them. Request a discount for this bulk purchase. Double Charges for Amenities: Point out that you're essentially paying double for amenities like water, STP, power backup, etc., by buying two flats. Negotiate a combined rate for these considering the shared usage. Structural Changes: Negotiate for the builder to absorb some or all the cost of structural changes needed for combining the flats. This is because it saves them the cost of finishing another separate unit. Payment Terms: If possible, offer a faster payment turnaround in exchange for a better price. This incentivizes the builder to close the deal quickly. Alternative: Express willingness to walk away if negotiations aren't satisfactory. However, ensure you have explored other options and are genuinely prepared to do so. Reaching Your Budget: With your budget of 1.6-1.7 Crore, aim for a price per square foot lower than the quoted 7000/sqft for the flats. Negotiate a combined price for the two flats that falls within your budget, considering the saved amenity charges and potential discount for structural changes."

Qualified professionals in particular are offered visa subclasses based on a points-tested basis, as these often lead to a permanent residency with a work permit. The points-test-based visa subclass is an interesting option for qualified workers because these are predominantly permanent visas. This visa is available for individuals with specific qualifications and experience. The Australian Government analyses the future demand for skilled workers and publishes the relevant occupations on the Skilled Occupations Lists. A skills assessment is required prior to application for this visa. An assessing authority assesses whether the individual’s qualifications are applicable and relevant to the occupation in question. For this particular visa subclass, eligible skilled workers are in demand Australia-wide.

            "This question is rather bizarre. It's not even a question. It looks like a command! It sort of asks the lawyers as to who among them is the 'best' And you have been waiting since 3 years and want the advocate to file a case for you 'urgently'! And you expect the advocate to call you at your whatsapp number also! This is like a patient expecting a doctor to call him and treat him Sir, first please learn how to address a professional, specially an advocate It is unprofessional for any advocate to call a prospective client. It's like solicitation. It's you who needs legal help. So understand that it is you who has to call the advocate after taking an appointment and pay his consultation fee. Admin: kindly don't allow such queries. Advocates are to be treated with respect. Such questions undermines the profession and its members. No question that requires the advocate to call the person ought to be allowed and even tolerated.",

        "full_text": "Can police file defamation case If I go to press on a false case they implicated on me. (Mentioned this story previously ) We (My Uncle his relative lady and myself) were going in the car. SI parked his vehicle partially blocking the road. My uncle called him 'Hello' meaning keep your vehicle aside. SI came and scolded us and took us to PS and filed (petty case U/s CP Act 70b and U/s IPC 186 obstructing public servant) on me. I pleaded guilty without knowing that I can contest. Now I got Court copy of the charge sheet and court order, below are the details: It has three papers 1st paper contains 'PETTY CASE CHARGE SHEET', contains my name address other details and brief facts where SI says 'I, SI of police checking roof tops for the bandobust of home minister, the respondent was going by his car and shouted 'Rey' at him. When asked (even after showing his identity), he argued and said \"do whatever you want\" and obstructed a government employee on duty and caused road obstruction...\" 2nd paper says (This was written by constable in the court in front of me after convincing me to change the story as he said otherwise I will go to 3 months remand) \"I Police Constable Ramulu performed BC-I area patrolling on VVIP program … one person by name Prashant parked his Vehicle on the road. I told him to remove your vehicle he do not remove the vehicle and argue with me and Obstruction of our duty\". 3rd paper contains: challan amount (Rs 50 for petty case and Rs 500 for ipc 186) and \"In default to suffer simple imprisonment for a persiod of 02 days for the offence....) I have few questions regarding this case... 1. As I told in other question SI and constable have filed a false case on me (I know I cannot reopen the case at least in the same court I think) and by looking at the first and second paper both stories are different how a court can accept such information and convict me. Now can I take this document to higher court and say they have clearly filed a false case on me and even the lower court has done mistake in not reading the papers correctly? 2. Actually I am planning to give a press interview (my relative is in press, they have a YouTube Telugu channel) with the above charge sheet and court order which is clearly false and also with my Uncle and his relative lady that Police cannot take senior citizens and lady to PS forcefully. My question is can police file any defamation case on me or media house as I have already pleaded guilty? 3. I am also planning to use SI and Constable's WhatsApp Photos to be used in press conference can police file any Defamation case on me or media house or both ? 4. If they file defamation cases for what amount or what would be the implications 5. In the third paper it said \"In default to suffer simple imprisonment...\" I did not go through any imprisonment. So If I go to press will there be any issue with this, will they ask me go through imprisonment? 6. Will there be any other legal issue or any other issue if I am going to press? Thanks.",
